I am a tv show creator/writer/producer. 

I have written a scripted historical drama tv series inspired by true events set in New York City, Lower East Side, circa 1900. 

The series uses as a scaffolding/structure a number of true/legitimate historical events, including among them never-fore-unmasked issues/connections regarding President Theodore Roosevelt, his administration AND the impact of certain key/inciting incidents by the show's co-female protagonists that played a major, and never before credited connection to his administration and a lasting impact by these events on the country still felt in contemporary American society. 

There are other key events of this ""never before told story"" that are easily ""google-able"" AND which have a high web presence and huge viral visibility. 

In addition to the actual episodes I have written for the show/series, I have also created an academic/thesis style paper that reflects these never-before revealed historical incidents. My paper is 44 pages long. Another 20 pages includes addenda regarding the actual tv series that sets the complete stage for the academic/historical incidents that are braided into the dramatic story. 

HERE IS THE JOB/TASK REQUIREMENT

I am seeking a Wikipedia Pro / Historian - Academic / Scholar / Writing Expert conversant in the described arenas/genres described above (and below)...

AND....

Using/taking my ""academic/thesis"" paper, along with other ""factual data"" using this info and then cross-referencing/citing MY academic/factual discoveries and integrating/adding the elements of my paper/tv show (for which there is an extensive and fabulous (presently unpublished website, we are not ready to go public with) AND have YOU integrate OUR facts/history, etc. into the webisphere adding OUR show info (facts/history) and include these bits of new and fascinating historical information/discoveries ON and INTO other Wikipedia Sites that specialize in these historical niches that our research AND the show addresses. The point of this exercise is that this will then drive traffic to, and link back to our show website and all other social media; all of this will create high level, highly credible awareness for our tv show/series and unmask this valuable educational information for a wide ranging audience. 

If you have proven expertise in Wikipedia, consider yourself a historical-enthusiast, OR, even better, are an academic/scholar with expertise in early 20th century history (story is set in NYC 1900), sub-niche exposure to President Theodore Roosevelt, Feminism, Feminist Movements, Jewish Feminism/ists, Early Jewish History, Early New York City/Lower East Side history, AND CAN WRITE.... then perhaps you might find this gig interesting.

I am a tv show creator/writer/producer. 

I have written a scripted historical drama tv series inspired by true events set in New York City, Lower East Side.

The series uses as a scaffolding/structure a number of true/legitimate historical events, including among them never-fore-unmasked issues/connections regarding President Theodore Roosevelt, his administration AND the impact of certain key/inciting incidents by the show's co-female protagonists that played a major, and never before credited connection to his administration and a lasting impact by these events on the country still felt in contemporary American society. 

There are other key events of this ""never before told story"" that are easily ""google-able"" AND which have a high web presence and huge viral visibility. 

In addition to the actual episodes I have written for the show/series, I have also created an academic/thesis style paper that reflects these never-before revealed historical incidents. My paper is 44 pages long. Another 20 pages includes addenda regarding the actual tv series that sets the complete stage for the academic/historical incidents that are braided into the dramatic story. 

HERE IS THE JOB/TASK REQUIREMENT

I am seeking a Wikipedia Pro / Historian - Academic / Scholar / Writing Expert conversant in the described arenas/genres described above (and below)...

AND....

Using/taking my ""academic/thesis"" paper, along with other ""factual data"" using this info and then cross-referencing/citing MY academic/factual discoveries and integrating/adding the elements of my paper/tv show (for which there is an extensive and fabulous (presently unpublished website, we are not ready to go public with) AND have YOU integrate OUR facts/history, etc. into the webisphere adding OUR show info (facts/history) and include these bits of new and fascinating historical information/discoveries ON and INTO other Wikipedia Sites that specialize in these historical niches that our research AND the show addresses. The point of this exercise is that this will then drive traffic to, and link back to our show website and all other social media; all of this will create high level, highly credible awareness for our tv show/series and unmask this valuable educational information for a wide ranging audience. 

If you have proven expertise in Wikipedia, consider yourself a historical-enthusiast, OR, even better, are an academic/scholar with expertise in early 20th century history (story is set in NYC 1900), sub-niche exposure to President Theodore Roosevelt, Feminism, Feminist Movements, Jewish Feminism/ists, Early Jewish History, Early New York City/Lower East Side history, AND CAN WRITE.... then perhaps you might find this gig interesting. 

Please respond with appropriate info - including of course, resume/cv that demonstrates all the above required abilities. Links, writing proof/samples, etc essential.   

This is a once-in-a-lifetime gig, we are looking for a one-in-a-million candidate/person that can and will immerse themselves in both the excitement and gravitas of this incredible opportunity.  We are posting this in NY, LA, Boston, Chicago and Miami; the creator/writer lives in South Florida.",compensation: TBN
