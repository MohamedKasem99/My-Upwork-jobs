We are Blaze Streaming - an event industry video production company based in Portland, OR.

We’re looking for experienced, highly-attentive, and fast video editors. 

We edit “Breakouts”, a type of presentation given at conventions and conferences. Each project will have several hundred edits. Each video consists of a picture-in-picture (PIP) graphics overlay, a record of a slide deck synced with audio, and 4k camera footage. The camera footage is placed in the PIP window, and keyframed to keep the presenter in the allotted space. Here’s a short example of what this looks like!: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5cZu4GWoQs&feature=youtu.be

Because of the high volume of our project deliverables, consistency and attention to detail in the edit is absolutely key. 

Among other projects, you’ll be editing videos from the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco.  For this show alone, the editing team as a whole will be delivering roughly 700 videos! This means moving fast and being efficient are must-have qualities for any editor on the Blaze team.

The position includes a paid Training Bootcamp, where you’ll learn the intricacies of our specialized workflow.

This will be an in-office gig (with the opportunity to eventually negotiate remote work). We’re located in the Foster-Powell neighborhood in SE Portland.

Preferred experience:
Keyframing
High volume projects
Adobe Premiere (must)

Here are the details:

Dates: Month of March (Training will start on March 2nd; may not last the whole week)
Rate: $20/hr (with the potential to grow quickly once competence is demonstrated).

You'll be given a rough cut of the video (with no images on green screen), along with short descriptions of what we'd like to see at each point in the video.

You're just doing the individual still graphics - we'll have someone else work on animation (unless you also do motion graphics, but our plan is to keep them separate).

We'll also give you access to our Shutterstock account, so you can pull vector graphics and images from there.

Here's what matters to us:

2. You are a total expert at Illustrator. (We use the newest version of Illustrator CC. Let us know if you have that version.)

NEED A VIDEO EDITOR WITH PREMIERE ADOBE CC 2020,"QR Code Link to This Post
            
        
Hi, my company shoots a lot of events that are all 1-4 days, sometimes once a month, sometimes several events a month, many times back to back. It’s usually a mixture of b-roll and interviews. Despite how organized our footage is we have a special method of sifting through every clip and organizing it into timelines in preparation for editing promotional videos or testimonial videos. It usually takes 6-15 hours to complete depending on how many days of footage there is. We need an extra person to help with this. You don't have to be in Scottsdale, any city in the Phoenix Metro area is fine.

Depending on the urgency of the project, we would have you pick up a copy of the hard drive, or mail you a copy of the hard drive, which has all the footage. You’ll be responsible for sifting through the clips, creating all of the timelines and then shipping/delivering the hard drive back to us. We usually need the hard drive back in 3-5 business days.  

All work can be done at your home or office, however, if you are chosen to help I will ask that you meet with me the first time so that I can show you a sample and give you instructions on how I like the clips sifted and timelines created. 

All work is contract work on a 1099 basis. When selected, you must submit a completed W9 and you must have a valid subscription to Adobe Premiere Pro CC 2020. 

Rate of pay will be $25-$40 per hour depending on project urgency, your experience, and reliability. Also, once you get familiar with our editing style there may be opportunities for you to edit promotional or testimonial videos at a higher rate. In fact, I'm also interest in highly skilled editors who can edit promotional type videos like the ones seen on our demo page on our website. If you think you qualify, please send your info and some samples!

Please reply to the Craigslist email with your interest, experience and contact info. We will reply ASAP if we chose to add you to our list of contractors. We look forward to working with you, thank you!

"Online Dating Ghostwriter: Impersonate Me on Dating Apps, Get Me Dates","QR Code Link to This Post
            
        
I don’t have time for online dating. It’s a chore. I also hate doing it. I love going on dates and having voice chat conversations, but I hate constant online texting and writing. I am looking for a writer to take that over for me.

I am looking for someone to login to my online dating sites and apps and do the online chatting for me. I will send you info about my hobbies, interests, and personality. I can also send chat transcripts of previous conversations. This will be for male on male LGBT dates, relationships, friendships, or hookups. These online chats may include the discussion of fetishes and kinks.

You would be working directly with me, a single guy looking to get online dates. When I chat with someone online, I typically like to chat with them for an hour or two with text chatting. I like to respond to their messages immediately in case they happen to be online. If the online chatting goes well after a while, I like to schedule a voice call, which is an easier and faster way to get to know someone and determine chemistry. If the voice call goes well, then I like to schedule an in-person meeting. While you, the writer, will obviously not be involved in the voice call, I would need your help for all online chatting that will take place before and after the voice call.

Pay is negotiable and may be based on the number of hours you spend chatting, or the number of messages you send, the length of those messages, or the quality of their content. A bonus may be given for each time I meet someone new for a date that you’ve chatted with online. Serious inquiries only! 

Since I am picky when selecting romantic partners, this gig is likely to last for many months, or even many years. It really depends on:
•	How affordable our negotiated compensation is to me
•	The time you spend chatting with online matches
•	The quality of your writing, and how well it accurately represents me
•	How well you respect my privacy when chatting with online matches
•	How easy you are to get a hold of for chats about writing feedback and strategic planning
•	If I start dating someone that I want to remain exclusive with, then we’ll pause the ghostwriting, but since I am picky, this is extremely likely to not happen for years

Here is the process I’d like to follow:
•	For each app/site, I may write my profile content for have you write the content
•	I select who I’d like contacted and send the list to you (or I just swipe right)
•	You send ice-breaker message to those candidates
•	Shortly after the candidates respond, you began a back-and-forth conversation, and continue it “live” especially if they are currently online or responding to messages immediately
•	I will give feedback on the conversations (does it sound like me, is it appropriate, etc.)
•	After online chatting with these candidates for a few weeks (or shorter or longer than that based on our subjective assessment for their receptivity), you will schedule a voice call
•	I will do a voice call chat with the candidate. Ideally this chat will last as long as needed to determine if I have chemistry with the candidate, like their personality, and want to meet. If so, I will make plans to meet them in person.
•	After I meet the candidate in person, I will most likely take it from there, but may ask you, the ghostwriter, to continue conversing with them afterwards. If I voice chat with the candidate, and we don’t nail down concrete plans to meet, then I may also ask for you to continue chatting with the candidate.

For each website and app we use for online dating, I will send you login information so that you can chat with everyone that I find interesting. The websites and apps that we’ll use may include, but are not limited to: Recon, Grindr, Tinder, Plenty of Fish, OK Cupid, Hinge, Howlr, and more.

You must use perfect grammar and spelling. If you’re interested, please reply to this ad. After exchanging a few e-mails, you must be available for a phone interview to determine if you are a fit for my needs. I look forward to someone taking over the writing chores out of online dating for me!","compensation: Pay is negotiable.

An Italian automotive love story for Valentines day. Need by Friday,"QR Code Link to This Post
            
        
Need a really FAST (need to go live for valentines; FRIDAY) and creative editor who is good at conveying emotional pieces like love stories. Can you make your audience cry by letting them truly feel the emotion of your piece?

Would like to produce a 10 minute short heartbreaking love story that serves as a reminder to all to hold on tight to those they love while they can. Also a message that even if you lose someone you can be happy again. I've already shot most footage and did a 6 minute cut, but the cut does not convey the emotion I want to. I want the viewer to really feel the pain in the story and be moved by it as well as uplifted.

Basically I want to supercharge the emotional power of the short and make sure the message is clear.

Looking for direction on how it should be cut. Music choice and other such elements to get the feeling I want. Would like an editor to recut it. Should be something that will get shared a ton and I'll gladly put your name all over it! Can we go Viral?

See below. This is not actually made as the short I want to make. This is part of the actual story I'm trying to tell. This video was made as an expression of love during the real life story I'm now trying to dramatize. Again, to be clear, the link below is a REAL video which is part of the story I'm now trying to tell. It was made for the love interest, not for theatrical purpose. The theatrical piece is what I want you to do.

VA based artist in Portland seeks muse,"QR Code Link to This Post
            
        
Please read entire post. Pretty please with a cherry on top. 

Artist looking for female model. (sorry fellas, next trip) Little to no experience is preferred. Not open to models who consider themselves aspiring models... I love ya... but just need regular folks this time. 

Curvy, thin...these things are not a factor. just real. 

OVER 25 please. 

TEXT NO EMAILS (It's fun to see who follows directions) photo/name/age please. If ya email, ya better be pretty damn charming. :) 

I'm VA based and on a road trip through Maine in the winter. Yeah, I know. :). When your passion is your job as it is mine, after a while you start to lose the passion and it becomes a job. So once a year I go somewhere I have never been, where I don't know a soul, and intensionally don't do a lot of research on the town the dark landed on. I go and work. work for fun, shoot WTF I want.. and ask people to join me on the ride. I know, sounds weird. It is. So hey Portland. What's up?

So, I approach my work like a jazz artist. No my instrument. Know where to be. know who I am playing with. Start to make noise, the muses will flutter, and the song will reveal itself. So I don't have any ideas. I don't have any concepts. You are the other musician. We will get to those things together.

I MIGHT have a pool to shoot in and do some underwater. MAYBE. I am not sure I want to work that hard.

Why CL? I don't know.. thought maybe I would reach folks that I normally wouldn't via FB or IG or blah blah. Plus IG models grrrr no no no. 

I hope to meet new folks who embrace new experiences and appreciate the work.

YOU WILL NOT BE ASKED TO REMOVE YOUR CLOTHES... No nudes, implied nudes, no underwear, no ""hey, let's try these fishnet stockings"" or creepiness in general. 

Happy to send my website and phone number and all that after we touch base. 

AGAIN - no emails. TEXT photo/name/age please.

"Need 3D Rendering of 2D Drawings (Fee=$1,000.00 to $1,500.00)","QR Code Link to This Post
            
        
All email RESPONSES ""MUST"" be SUBMITTED between TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 11TH AND MONDAY, FEBRUARY 17TH because ""Time Is Of The Essence.""


We would like a 3D rendering of 2D drawings of our house (presently under construction) as drawn by our architect. Final second and third floor plans (with a lap pool in the backyard) are due from the architect this week. 

Please respond in your first email if you would like to have the architect plans for our house on the lake sent to you in order for you to visualize the project and/or create several sample pages of our house for us to better ""see"" the style and quality of your work. The successful candidate will have both our architect's and our landscape architect's plans (for site location and topography) emailed to them. Photos of work done so far are available upon request. Please supply your name, address, cell phone number and your email.


Perfect is not required; however, if you can do perfect for the above fee, then, well....     Poor and fair are not acceptable either (they would be rejected for insufficient quality and that person would not continue working on the project)....she or he must be able to do what is in this posting plus what we discuss in our first meeting. In addition to the above fee for services there will be a $100.00 fee paid per visit to the man or woman who gets this project for each of three planned meetings. This would raise the total fee paid to the 3D person into the range of $1,300.00 to $1,800.00.


We hope the 3D rendering person will be able to complete this project in about 40 person-hours. To give an estimate of rate of pay, think of the fee as follows: If the negotiated fee is $1,600.00 (it could be higher or lower) and the project takes 40 hours then (given this theoretical example) the rate of pay would be $40.00 per hour. 


My wife and I would like to see: (1)  3D of the different rooms with some furniture and fixtures; (2) the lap pool that is outside the rear wall of the garage facing the lake, and, (3) the exterior of the house, which is 8,500 square feet.   There are a lot of rooms and, if possible, can your 3D include a ""virtual walk-through?""Architect's plans have all the measurements, including elevator, 10 foot ceilings and 24 inch trusses. Our concrete floor slab (including the four car garage slab) and all of the concrete foundation walls have been poured and awaiting the framing stage. 


""Time is of the essence"" -- so we would like to hire a woman or man quickly who can do the 3D ASAP +
with sufficient quality to allow us to ""see"" our future house on computer prior to framing (scheduled for later this month or in early March) so that if we decide to make any changes based upon the 3D views then the changes would be on paper and not in ""Brick & Mortar."" 


While we are waiting for the rain to stop delaying the timeline set by our contractor, my wife and I would like to hire a person to do the 3D renderings before framing begins. Whoever answers that they are able and have the time to do the project rather quickly ""must"" provide ""three items"" as part of an ""email response"":  (1) She or he MUST give us DIGITAL SAMPLES of their prior work product;  (2) we will need a fixed price for the 3D renderings (ok to base it upon the square footage...$1.50/ft; $1.75/ft -- plus or minus); and, (3) the 3D renderings must be able to be downloaded to our laptops so that we can view and wander around the 3D of the interior and exterior. 


Price is negotiable within the above range depending on samples provided. The total price for the 3D drawings cannot exceed the above budget maximum. We are searching for a woman or man who has the talent to do the renderings of the house interiors with furniture and fixtures, with the lap pool facing the lake, and, with outside 3D of the external of the house. The successful person wants to get paid for this project plus add our home to their portfolio, i.e., he or she is a person who can do this independently. Upon successful completion of this project we will gladly be a reference to the 3D rendering person for work well done and recommended because of his or her excellent work creating our 3D drawings. 


The person selected should meet with us at three ""planned visit"" times: (1) planning and communication; (2) first draft explained; and, (3) final draft explained. For each of these three meetings the person will be paid separately at the rate of $100.00 per visit in addition to the budgeted amount paid to the selected person. All fees paid C.O.D. with progress payments at mutually agreed upon ""milestones"" of work product submitted to owners and accepted by them as to quality. 


We will work with you online and by phone and by text to assist as much as possible with any questions, issues, etc. that arise while you are working. We wish to be communicating with you while you are working so that the three of us can move the project forward quickly by not allowing some of the 3D to be created and us not approving it, e.g., we don't think something is correct so the three of us talk about it, thereby assuring that the three of us won't have any portion of the 3D renderings ""sent back"" for editing and the budgeted ""time is of the essence"" goal is achieved. This will also make alterations possible while 3D renderings are in your thoughts and not yet put into the computer. 


We are looking for a man or woman who will complete our ""three-person team"" by interacting and communicating (excellent written and verbal communications a ""must"") with us to rapidly, and with few, if any, ""re-do"" requests for the 3D computer renderings. We operate and believe it is ""ok"" to make mistakes....you won't be ""jumped on"" for any first-time errors as long as you learn from it and ""do not"" make the same error more than once, i.e., simply put, ""Please do not make the same mistake twice.)


Thanks to you who ask to be considered. I expect NOT to be able to answer all emails, so please accept my thanks to all of you here as a group rather than in a personal email to each of you thanking you for contacting us for consideration.

Warm Regards, 

-Steve","compensation: Budget is $1,000.00 to $1,500.00 Plus $300.00 ($100.00 per visit for 3 visits to customer)"

I'm a senior software engineer in the Bay Area. I've taught myself design and enjoy taking on product manager responsibilities at work. I'm currently working full-time and I have no time to work on this journaling app that I put my blood sweat and tears into.

I want to hire an Android Product Engineer per-project. First project I have in mind is adding a swipeable menu for each recycler view item. My journaling app's main screen is a recycler view. Each item represents a single entry from the day's entries. 

Here's my app: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.compscieddy.writeaday

My current job has taught me the importance of valuing my time: being very careful which feature I choose to spend my time on. I maximize for impact and so I'm looking for a partner engineer that is also able to ruthlessly prioritize their own time as well. This means making the right trade-off in terms of the ""right"" engineering architecture vs a quicker implementation solution.

I really believe in this vision of building a journaling app that can truly complement our lives. The best app for writing everything about what you've done. It's an amazing feeling to be building something that has people constantly writing in about how the app has helped them.

Text me at 248-622-3842. Briefly tell me where you're coming from, what you're currently up to, and how working on Writeaday with me will help get you where you're headed to.",compensation: Per-project. Ex: adding swipeable menu to recycler view item $50
PHP Programmer XML to JSON,"QR Code Link to This Post
            
        
Hi,

I have a PHP script that has been written but needs one last piece done and I do not have the time to do it.
The script makes a soap call and returns a XML result that is stored in an XML file in the same directory. That XML file needs to be processed into a usable JSON file.

I have 15 years of experience in Programming and someone who knows what they are doing with XML and JSON should be able to do this in under 30 minutes with no problem. I got close but was getting issues in getting the XML to actually go into a JSON string.

If you can get this done in under 30 min for $25 there will be a lot more work ahead for you as we are doing a massive online marketing campaign that will require many more jobs like this and even more complicated ones.

Once again if you have gotten this far put I AM IN THE USA in your subject line.

Mobile App Developer,"QR Code Link to This Post
            
        
Hello,

I'm looking for a local mobile app developer, full stack. Someone who wants to make something new and different and start fresh. I have little knowledge in coding and software development however I am a current business owner with an electrical engineering education that wants to start another new exciting business. It will be a market place type mobile and eventually web app. It will focus on community and mutual benefits withing a shared market. (I know that's kind of vague, but I'll explain more in detail during interviews) I like to find someone to start this with me. It doesn't  have to be perfect by any means. We can work on the MVP together and get a simple working prototype out locally in Franklin, TN. 

What I expect from you:
- Honesty.
- Excited to build something new that puts people first, then product.
- Be able to build a new app, not full featured, not perfect, but functioning.
- Be able to communicate what you need when you need help.
- Someone that doesn't want a typical job at this time.
- Willing to learn, listen, collaborate, grow and work hard.
- Eventually help with growth if this app picks up.
- Willing to eventually have more equity and manage the tech growth.

What you will expect from me/the company:
- Honesty, Transparency.
- A focus on you and the needs of our users.
- Business Development: Structure, marketing, legal, finances, investments, etc. (Don't need to worry about any of it, but I will be transparent about all of it.
- Offering you equity as we grow. (I mean, come on, you pretty much built this, you deserve a good equity stake at no cost, and over time. We can discuss this plan more).
- A place to work. I can pay for your shared office space subscription here in Franklin.

Summary:
I can't pay you hourly. I haven't even formed the corporation yet. As I mentioned, as far as compensation, I can pay for a workplace, and I can offer equity depending on work and contribution of your service. Yes, I'm basically looking for a technical co-founder in a sense or at least, employee 1 with good equity. I can also pay for gas and lunch at times. No problem. I am running another business at this same time. As we grow and launch this, compensation will be more like a ""normal"" job would be. For lack of better words. We'll cross that bridge when we get there and after we get some seed investments. So if you are a student, or if you are learning to code on your own, or if you have time to start something new and want to partner while still coding and developing, this could be a cool project. I like staying local. I don't want to partner with someone out of state or country. Lets start this project and hang out at the coworking space that will be paid for by me personally. Even if you are in school or part time working or freelancing other projects. I don't mind, you can use the space while working on this too.

""What are we doing with our lives?"" You know? haha

Let's do something new, cool, and different here in Middle TN. I'd love to tell you more.

Thanks!

Graphic Designer for book Chapter Headings,"QR Code Link to This Post
            
        
I'm finishing up a book writing project... The title is ""Living Large 4 Less"".   It's designed to help everyday people get the most out of their hard earned money.    The whole book is going to be printed in full color including every page so the reader can get a full color experience.

What I'm looking for is a creative design header for each of the 13 chapters.    Besides the title... I want a graphical
treatment that is upbeat, progressive, and visual.   The header can occupy up 1/3 of the top of the page.

Layout is 6"" wide... 9"" tall... pretty common book size.   I've included the first 5 chapter titles along with the 
a bit of copy that starts each chapter.    While I was writing the book I grabbed some art off of google images
to give an idea of what the the title covered.   I am having all the illustrations associated with each chapter redone by a gifted illustrator.   

What I'm wanting is a talented Graphic Designer to come up with a treatment that can incorporated with the title.
I kinda like the font I've used already... but if you are a talented Graphic Designer... I'm open to your ideas and concept.      I've got a budget of $100 for each chapter heading banner.   

I'm including the current chapter headers ....   Also I'm including the cover
art for the book so you can get an idea of the initial style for the book.   What ever you come up with needs
to be something that I can ultimately legally use - copyright.   

I'm sure you probably have a website that shows me some of your past work... All well and good, but my main 
interest is what your ideas/ treatment looks like using  my project content.   Pick any title you like and
show me what you can create.   Impress me.. and you get to do all of them.

Writting job avaible in atlanta,"QR Code Link to This Post
            
        
JOB DESCRIPTION
Basically, a writer is someone who writes for a living, creating fiction (e.g. novels, short stories, scripts for films, theatre and television), non-fiction (e.g. biographies, autobiographies, web content and reference books) or poetry. They often work as freelancers.

Some writers are commissioned to write television scripts, whilst others will write articles for magazines and newspapers. Other writers may work as ‘ghostwriters’ (writing on behalf of someone else, under their name). Novelists and writers of non-fiction books tend to spend their time working on one single project, which takes a lot longer to produce.

A writer usually needs to do research, writing, editing, fact-checking, adapting and rewriting. More popular writers may even need to attend book signings or give press interviews for publicity purposes.

SALARY & BENEFITS
There is certainly money to be made as a writer. However, there is quite a disparity between the earnings of the most successful writers and the lesser known writers out there.

Many full-time writers in the UK actually do other jobs to support their writing. Some work in academia and others undertake freelance copywriting and editorial projects for other publications.

Often, the actual income that writers earn from their writing can be less than £10,000 a year.

Of course, those who are more successful will receive better pay. For instance, novelists usually receive no less than £100,000 for the television and film rights of their works (and that doesn’t even include the extra income they will generate from the resulting increase in book sales).

The top screenwriters in the industry can also receive an annual salary of more than £100,000.

WORKING HOURS
Writers might work during holidays and weekends. After all, a writer’s work doesn’t tend to be restricted by conventional working hours. The career path of a freelance writer can lack a certain amount of job security, as success is often dependent on people’s opinions and fluctuating market trends.

The job can sometimes be lonely, since writers don’t work in an office, and rarely work alongside other people. However, a writer’s career will allow you to have a great amount of freedom, as you won’t be shackled to a desk in a sterile office environment.

ENTRY
Many writers have degrees in English, journalism, or creative writing. However, writers from other academic backgrounds are actually very common. In fact, many successful writers don’t even have undergraduate degrees.

A degree may be useful when applying for other jobs, and writing programmes do strengthen one’s writing skills, but the industry is one that honours talent and ability in spite of academic credentials.

Writers can take short writing courses for training purposes. Postgraduate degrees aren’t necessary, but can provide essential training for those focusing on a specific area of writing.

Basically, all you need are excellent writing skills, an individual writing style, excellent time management, stupendous research skills and a talent for networking.",no pay

ISO anyone w/ great English grammar written & oral - f Russian student,"QR Code Link to This Post
            
        
Hello, 

I'm trying to help my friend find a native english speaking person (with just a regular Southern California accent) who would be interested in either a language exchange (she'd help you to learn Russian while you help her to learn English), or as a paid tutor. 

The rate if paid is low because she is paying from Russia where the earnings are much lower than here in California (we'd pay via paypal) (average earnings in her town in Russia are about $150 - $400 per month). 

We are thinking about $6/hr. So this is really just for someone who wants to make friends online with a smart Russian adult girl. We'd prefer a female guide so that she can more closely emulate exactly how you pronounce words, etc. Any person from high school age and older with good english grammar in written and spoken communication would be ideal. 

Tutoring would occur using an online platform that's like Skype, but lets you both view a PDF textbook at the same time. All you do is chat in English, and help guide her through a PDF of an english course or text book that we'd find online.

Ideally we'd have 2 lessons a week at 8am, with each lesson lasting about 1.5 hours. 

If you are interested, please just write us a few sentences about yourself. Please also indicate whether you'd like a language exchange, or to be paid. If $6/hr is too low, let us know what would be interesting for you.

Mainly we're just looking for a fun and nice person who is patient and enjoys the English language. We definitely do NOT need anyone with prior experience in tutoring. She just wants to practice talking and writing. 

It's a little like helping your little sister with english homework, except she might be older than you (she's mid 20's).",compensation: $50+ /month for 2-3hrs/wk

ElasticSearch Wordpress Filtering Help,"QR Code Link to This Post
            
        
I am looking for someone who is fluent in ElasticSearch and can help implement search filters on a WordPress website. 

The details: I have a WordPress website with Woocommerce installed on it.  The site has more than 40,000 products, each with variations as well as custom fields.  The site is hosted with Cloudways and I am using their self hosted ElasticSearch installation.  This is powered through Wordpress with the Elasticpress plugin.  Currently elasticsearch works on the site but I can only do searches in the search field.  

Needs: I need someone who can help create search filters/facets to help filter posts in our Woocommerce store based on the values in the custom fields.  Search filters would consist of dropdowns, check boxes, and possible range sliders.  Because of the size of the site it is imperative that this integrates with Elasticsearch.  

Background: I have tried using numerous filtering plugins but all of them fall short.  The challenge is getting them to work with Elasticsearch.  Each plugin wants to build its own index of the search and the site is just too large for that to work which is why I am using Elasticsearch.  Elasticseach is hosted on our cloudways server and we would like to keep it that way for now because of cost restrictions.  

If you are familiar with elasticsearch, Wordpress and search filtering using custom fields then please reach out to me with your hourly rate.  Thank you.",compensation: Project based.

Remote study - $200 for Developers,"QR Code Link to This Post
            
        
This study will run Tuesday, Feb 25 and Thursday, Feb 27

If you are a back-end or fullstack developer , you are likely a fit for this study.
If you would like to be in a 60 minute one on one interview that asks you questions about the work you do as a developer and your experiences, please let us know. The study pays $200 Visa cash card, or Amazon $200 cash credit, and we send that within 24-48 hours after you complete your interview.

This interview is NOT a test, it's to help a product team understand more about the needs of users. It will be a one on one interview.

To qualify, please respond with this info:
1) Your age. You should be between 18 to 65 years old:
2) What is your employment Status:(FT,PT,Self-employed,Student,Other) :
3) Do you create software applications,build/write computer code, or develop websites or complex macros?
4) What best describes your primary job responsibilities (FT developer,PT Developer, Architect, QA/Test, OpsStudent/Hobbyist or Other)?
5) Please give us your email address and phone number as Craigslist does not give us a way to know these things and we will want to contact you to get you in the study!

The fine print:
• We take your privacy very seriously and will *never* sell your information or share it without your prior written consent. If you ever request to be removed from our contact list, we will do that promptly.
• Please remember that you should be nearly 100% confident that you can attend the session we book you for. Our ability to continue to recruit and schedule participants for studies at various clients is based largely on show-rates. If you need to cancel and are unable to find a qualified replacement, we may not be able to invite you to future studies. We have had far too many people agree to be in studies and then decide they can't make it. This is bad for everyone. Anyone who is a no-show for one of our studies will not be eligible for future studies.
• You should also account for Seattle traffic. It's never good, so please be aware that it'll take you a while to park, check-in etc. The lab has free soda and other beverages, so it'll be totally worth it.
• You will be asked to sign a research participation form (AKA an NDA). Your compensation will be mailed to the address you give us, so be sure you give us the correct info!
• We have had a few people ""fake"" their way into studies recently. If we discover someone intentionally lied their way into a study by misrepresenting their job, or themselves, they will be permanently banned from future participation. Also, as of 2019, we will not pay anyone who is discovered to have lied their way into a study.
• We reserve the right to remove anyone from a study who has not signed their paperwork at least 24 hours before the study.

My mother is 84, and up until 3 years ago, she was in very good health throughout. 

But her very young sister passed away, and she became depressed; so she just lays in bed all day, and gets up only to eat. 

No physical activities whatsoever, and consequently, she gained 60 pounds just this last year. 

I need a professional, who visits her Park La Brea apartment at least once a week, who can help her overcome her depression. 

Spanish is her first language (she's from Argentina). 

Can you tell me about your experience / expertise, and what you would charge please?

Graphic Artist,"QR Code Link to This Post
            
        
Hi, my name is Dan and I am the father of a boy with muscular dystrophy.  I have been a very strong advocate and fundraise for the MDA ever since my son was diagnosed.  We have moved our efforts up and are planning our 3rd annual car show. Jacob's Legs Motor for Muscles.  We provide a car show and concert at the annual MDA Muscle Walk.  This is a very special day for families living and fighting muscle disease.

I have built a tribute car, ""Jacob's Legs Muscular Dystrophy Muscle Car"",  that I campaign all spring and summer at motorsports events in the Boise region.  I would like to see if a big-hearted graphic artist can help me create a very cool graphic of my car so I can put it on tee shirts and add another revenue stream for our car show this October.  It would have to be a gift, as this is charity work.

We are doing marketing for several reputable B2B clients, and need to reach out to thousands of people over social media. Due to limitations from some of these platforms, we are offering a month-to-month referral marketing program in order to increase our outreach efforts. We'll pay you $200 per month. Once your referral account is set up, nothing else is needed from your side other than turning in your referral invoices. We are going to be reaching out to promote different business products such as software and phone systems. All that we'll be doing is asking people to connect, by sending connection requests. When they do connect, we will send them information on the products and see if they would like to move over to email, and eventually have a phone conversation.

This is suitable for someone who is not so active on social media. Basically if you have an account, but don't care about it much, then this will be fine. Also, pay will be upfront every month.

Whenever this ends, you will have a very large number of connections, which can be seen as a nice asset to have. 

If you are interested, send me your name and email.",compensation: $200/month

I'm a local painter and need help creating social media content. I have a marketing background and am looking for someone creative and reliable to create batches of content around my artwork. You can view my website here: https://luzdonahue.com/

You:

*Love coming up with fun and creative photoshoot ideas for both editorial and product shoots-- you're clever at figuring out location and staging and will be responsible for this
*You don't mind doing a little admin work (scheduling social media posts with text provided, researching hashtags, light email, photo editing, creating on Canva)
*You pick up new software easily 
*You write professionally but with personality 
*You are comfortable adding class listing, blog posts, and creating light landing pages on Squarespace 
*You have fun, but you get your shit done on time (you will be asked to set your own deadlines and to meet them)
*You have your own laptop (I have a DSLR you can use)
*You can come to Felton twice per month and meet in person in Santa Cruz at least once per week. 
*Mailchimp experience is a plus
*You're okay being paid as an independent contractor
*This is worth doing for you because you want an amazing portfolio-- looking for students who are building their portfolio, not seasoned professionals with high rates

Me:

* I have high standards, but I am not unrealistic or micromanaging. I am not going to tell you how to do every little thing and I expect you to take ownership for your tasks
*Scheduling is very flexible. I just need you to set timelines and meet them. The idea candidate can spend 5-10 hours on my project per week roughly, but you can also do all the work in a couple of weekends if that works better for you. 
*I have cats- so please let me know if you're allergic so we can imprison them if you come by
