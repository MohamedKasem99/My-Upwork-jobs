Model needed.

In addition to my commercial photography practice, I teach. Every quarter I teach a small lighting workshop for portraiture. I need your unique talent, ans interesting faces. 

This is the case for Feb, 8 2020. I need a good model. The gig is in Palo Alto, CA (SF bay area silicon valley) It is 8:30 am to 4:30pm with a lunch break for an hour.  This job is pretty low key, do your own makeup, you will remain clothed, and have some different looks and perhaps changes of clothes.  Not a Model Mayhem style gig. 

The pay is $125 and good photos from the day taken by me or my students. I will buy you lunch.  I recognize this gig is not for everybody; it won't make you famous or rich, nevertheless, I have a budget and a small class of very good photographers; I CAN feed you, provide you with a paid chance to get some GREAT PHOTOS for your book. 

Send me a lucid introductory note about yourself; with some references and/or some portfolio pics I can see. Please have a car, be on time, fun to work with. If interested please write me a note and show me some photos here on MM. … ~PLEASE NOTE~ the location of Palo Alto before you reply. Thank You! ~TEU",compensation: $125.00
