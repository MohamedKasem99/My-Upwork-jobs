BODYBUILDERS WANTED FOR COMEDY VIDEO,"QR Code Link to This Post
            
        
I'm a TV writer and producer seeking three bodybuilders (2 male and 1 female or all 3 males) to act in a comedy video about Muscle Beach. If you've ever wanted to do some performing outside of bodybuilding, this is a great and fun opportunity! It would just be one day of shooting in one location -- so pretty simple.

I've written for several television shows, but I've also always made Youtube videos on the side, mostly for fun. This video would be somewhere in between that. If it comes out well, it could serve as a proof-of-concept for a TV show pitch. I'm happy to share all my credentials and Youtube videos to anyone interested in applying. Thanks! I look forward to hearing from you!",no pay

It is tough sometimes to find the perfect niche because some products out there are basically fads that will fizzle  out and that means sales as soon as the next big thing comes out in the world. I have personally checked out around  ten different opportunities and was just was not sure it was the right move to make. I have even joined and found that my “team” was less than supportive which did not boost my moral. 

There is a company I found that has been selling for 40+ years and only getting better. They sell Identity Theft Protection as well as advice and help with all of the services listed in the picture. Everyday this service is available to people by pressing an app on their phone for a very low monthly membership  fee. Total piece of mind not having to worry about paying thousands to an attorney if the situation arose. What Your role is would be to let others know about this great opportunity that would benefit many.

The team as a whole are awesome and supportive, always there to help with issues and offer support and care. MY team is phenomenal and I am  very fortunate to have been paired up with such great mentors. 

I am looking for people to join this team of mine and to make it even better, this is a niche you can count on to not fizzle out wondering what to do next.

The  financial reward for offering this wonderful benefit to people as well as the opportunity for you to quickly scale up within the company is skies the limit so if you are great with people, networking and have the vision and the drive to work hard and be a gigantic success in 2020 please email me and I will connect with you.

I want to make a shirt for myself and everyone on my team, centered around a gold YouTube play button and also some sort of Gold Facebook logo. I am fully open to design ideas, which can include our channel name, RandySantel just for advertisement purposes, or not if it would look better without it. I will put this on premium shirts, and not $3 ones since I want these to look great for everyone to wear. 

In addition to this, I also want another shirt designed for our store http://www.foodchallengestore.com

This will be a tougher and more intensive task than the above one, and I'd like the same person to create both. Please let me know if you are interested and include a portfolio and pricing.

Firstly, let me tell you that this is an actual gig. I am an actual person. I am not some creepy dude with a weird fetish that wants to take even creepier photos of your toenails or something. 

I am a 42 (did I just publicly say that ugh!) year old woman, mother of 2 and wife if 1. I am starting an online business where I will be selling custom designed clothing, accessories a mind jewelry using vintage materials. 

I've got everything ready to; awesome website, bitchin products and even product pictures. But upon reflection, some of the clothing and jewelry needs to be shown on an actual person(s). *psssst! (That's where you come in!)

I need three models. Female, identifying as female. Etc. I need 1 plus size model and two model size models as many of the original vintage clothes are tiny. I have no preference to appearance other than that you are attractive and make my products look great. I'd really love to hire a 65 plus model, a 40 something model and a 20 something model. So if you fit that, please contact me!

I dont care if you are a pro or have never modeled before. If your look is what I'm going for, I can style and pose you and get what I need. 

I am so far from wealthy that it is not even funny, so I cant throw stacks of cash at you. However. After careful thought, this is what I am offering:
-$50 Modeling Fee for an 6 Hour Day. 
-Digital copies of all photographs. Both edited and unedited that you can use for whatever you'd like. I ask only that you credit my companies name for what you are wearing in it should you post it online etc. I will credit you as a professional model on my website. 
-1 Piece of Jewelry from my line. (I pick).
-Professional hair and makeup. I am a professional makeup artist. Like a real one, not someone who does cut-crease videos on Instagram. On the day of the shoot I'll do your hair and makeup. So if I were you, I'd line up a date afterward cuz you will be looking amazing. ..I'll also be doing the photography. I told you I am not wealthy, but I am really good at what i do. And creatively, I produce nice things. 
-My lifelong appreciation, admiration, eternal wonderment and reverence. 
-Positive feedback. I'll give you the model equivalent of a fantastic Yelp review or whatever models do. Plus I'll recommend you to anyone professionally who asks. Also you may use me as a reference. For modeling. You may not use me as a reference for like buying a car or something. 

So... you in? If so, please send me and EMAIL. *Please, please. Please dont text me.* 
Here's what to do:
1. Please use the subject line: CC Modeling Applicant

2. In the email please include: 
-height and weight (be honest, eventually we will meet in person)
-hair and eye color 
-measurements
-Dress, pant, jean, top, jacket, bra and shoe size
- please list any bisavke tattoos and piercings.

-- Please answer the following questions:
- Do you have pierced ears?
- Do you have any metal allergies?
- Do you have any material allergies?

Tell me a bit about you. I dont need your life story, of course. 

3. Please attach a few photos. Most helpful would be a headshot and a full length head-to-toe shot. Please NO filters. I mean it! I want to see YOU, not some weird, digitized, plumped, plucked, sucked and blurred version of you. :) ;) 

Hmmm... I'm sure I'm forgetting something so if u have any questions please feel free to email me. I'm really hoping this will be a positive experience for both of us.

Internship Opportunity for the NYSCA funded feature ""Pocahontas Returns"" at the New York studio of the international artist Nadja Verena Marcin (www.nadjamarcin.com) at Kunstraum LLC (kunstraumllc.com).

Looking for a Production Assistant Intern. Must be available to work on the project prep in Jan/Feb 2-3 days per week and be available for 6 shooting days in the second half of February 2020 (mostly weekends).

We are shooting the first ""New York"" part of the film which is set between New York and Bolivia. Become the right hand of Assistant Director and Producers, responsibilities include:

· Various research assignments for props, costumes, locations, cast, crew, production, mood boards, music, others.

Marcin's first feature film ""Pocahontas Returns"" has been awarded funding for the Fiscal Year 2019 by the New York State Council on the Arts. The project is fiscally sponsored by the New York Foundation for the Arts.

Taking its title from the historical, native American chief’s daughter POCAHONTAS, the film uses the title as an abstract theme, shading light on a world that yearns for and celebrates the foreign in a time filled with the renaissance of indigenous cultures, and a new female self-consciousness. As the world quickly adapts to a future of mobility and multi-nationality, ethical and cultural questions need translation, re-evaluation, and freedom to exist. The film is based on an authentic story of two people from different cultures falling in love.

Marcin's work has been presented at Minnesota Street Project SF; Fridman Gallery NY; Microscope Gallery NY; Elizabeth Foundation NY; Abrons Art Center NY; SCHAUWERK Sindelfingen; ZKM - Museum for Art and Media, Karlsruhe; Garage Museum of Contemporary Art, Moscow; Zendai MOMA, Shanghai (Himalajas Art Museum); Museo National de Arte, La Paz; Veneto Videoart Archive, Verona; Museum Ludwig, Cologne; Berkeley Art Museum, Berkeley; ICA Philadelphia; Kunstmuseum, Bonn; 5th Moscow International Biennale for Young Art, Moscow; Haus der Kunst, Munich, and other venues.

Overall, the first and foremost project is taking a never used, and never activated dual SIM smartphone from 2014, and to first back it up with a restore disk, then set it up to use GNOME Linux for Smartphones. Then to successfully activate the service with my carrier. After this, lock it down to be highly secure, and cognizant of high privacy values. Then lastly, to back this up with a restore disk.
The second project is to speed up the boot process and and overall functionality speed of an Ubuntu graphical user interface. When first installed on to the USB drive, it was fast! Now, it takes at least 30 minutes to boot up and about a minute to react to any application link inside the GUI operating system. This, after installing through the automatic process several applications from their Ubuntu store.
That is the whole of this gig. I am taking bids. Please let me know your best rate. And there will be more Linux projects later. CALLS AND TEXT MESSAGES TAKEN 09:00 TO 18:00 STARTING 2020-01-24. I thank you for your consideration.",compensation: Taking bids.

Seeking participants for self development program,"QR Code Link to This Post
            
        
I am seeking participants for a self development and goal setting program.

The program provides way to transform and heal the inner self by forming an awakened state by synchronized breathing practice , yoga poses, and sitting in guided meditations with peer-to-peer instruction and practice.

Although today there is a wide spread knowledge and practice of eastern wisdom traditions of yoga and meditation, and we have more self-help books of every kind to guide us, this doesn’t seem to make a meaningful difference in the everyday experience of most peoples lives, with anxiety and depression at all time highs. 

The system I have designed is based on research indicates the number on reason for failure in self-development is failure to do the exercises independently and failure to recognize results as they manifest.

Through  peer-to-peer  accountability, we will attempt to go deeper using mind manifestation techniques as a way  to foster trust in the self and to deprogram social and cultural imposed limiting beliefs and achieve your greatest possibility.

No experience is necessary, however participants should be able to create a list of 3 things they would like achieve and be able to meet in person for two hour session in Los Angeles, for 6 weeks every Thursday between the hours of 5 to 7 pm, as well as be willing and able to perform the practices on their own time 30 minutes daily.

WRITING WORKSHOPS for SPIRITUAL and NON-SPIRITUAL Writers,"QR Code Link to This Post
            
        
Have a script to polish? Want your spiritual (or non-spiritual) story told in Film, TV, or on Stage?

Need a finalized script to send to the networks/studios or producers soon?


Sign up for this Writing Workshop Series I'm hosting in Los Angeles!

Dates for 2020: Feb 4, 11, 18, 25
7PM – 8PM, Tuesday
Location: Liberate Hollywood
6365 Selma Ave, Los Angeles, CA 90028

To Register, call Liberate Hollywood ASAP at: (323) 745-0495

My name is Lapis Tiger and I'm currently the Executive Producer on a $50MM budget spiritual feature film on Mary Magdalene, and a $2.85MM budget Action Mystery/Thriller TV pilot.

I'm a Writer/Director, Script Consultant, Actress, and Motivational Speaker who has created content that generated interest from some of the top studios and networks in Hollywood! With over 12 years of film production and directing experience, I have worked with the former VP of Marvel, Honda, Ford, Red Bull, IGN, GAMEVIL, Microsoft, and Apple. Previous projects I consulted on include a superhero feature film, an international drama film, and an action series.

My writing workshops will go over:

-tools to critique your own writing, and how to check if the story playing out in your head is the same as what the audience is seeing

-building strong escalations, character developments, and clarifying your characters’ goals and core wounds

-writing from the heart and meditation techniques that help get your mind in the right creative space

-sample great scripts and what makes them stellar

-feedback from the Instructor and students during live reads of your script

-live performances on stage of what you’ve written so you can see what works and what doesn’t (digital footage of the recorded performances will be provided)

Testimonials:

""Lapis Tiger gave incredibly thorough, detailed notes for my short film script, 'Ahma & Alan,' during pre-production (the film will be premiering at the 2020 Seattle Asian American Film Festival). Her insight really helped me hone in on what was essential in each scene and pare away what distracted from the story. She has a deep understanding of emotion, character, and narrative, which she’s able to articulate clearly and succinctly, making her an excellent teacher.""
- James Y. Shih
Writer and Director of “Ahma & Alan”

""When I discovered Lapis Tiger about two years ago, I was struggling with a screenplay for what was essentially 'the origin story' of my connected superhero universe. After speaking via phone, we met up, and Lapis was full of questions about all the characters. When she agreed to come onboard, she was armed with so many layered and textured individuals to weave my grand epic around. I have learned a lot from her, which is why we continue to work together. Currently, we are working on a comic book project as well as the script for a new webseries, but in the back of my head, I have this ulterior motive of Lapis one day in the near future directing a film for me because she now has such a firm understanding of my vision.""
-Sergio W. Willis
Writer and Creator of the not quite superheroic webseries, ""Sasquatch and The Mythology Sisterhood,"" and Creator of the kaiju-flavored comic book, ""Gerbilla""

OPEN to all Spiritual and Non-Spiritual Writers!

Festival Life- Van-Life Adventure Models,"QR Code Link to This Post
            
        
I am the inventor of a Revolutionary Camping Product that will make Festival Life and Van Life much more comfortable and practical and FUN! Meanwhile I am quickly gaining other partners for this Adventure Tour I am about to embark on in my Short Bus-""Adventuremobile"" 

The Tour will be multi faceted and will encompass things like, snorkeling, tree swings, pristine swimming holes, disc diving(will explain later) biking, van life, festival life, demoing cutting edge E Scooters, Water Scooters, and other Radical new outdoor items. On any given day or week we could be snorkeling in the Crystal Clear Waters of the keys or a Crystalline River, or promoting the various products at random gear shops or surf shops, or at a Surf Comp, or White Water Comp (as the river waters get warmer!) or at an outdoor trade show, or at a random Festival along the way.  Meanwhile I have already procured several sponsors and partners for this tour who will be assisting with some of the logistical expenses as well as promotions and swag and product to sell at various events and festivals.

I have been to over 100 Festivals in my lifetime, LIB, Hulaween, Sonic Bloom, Lucidity, and Electric Forest are among my favorites, EDM, Jam Bands, Blue Grass and Reggae are my grooves. I am plant medicine friendly, and everything in moderation is the flow I try to stay in. 

The focus of this tour will be to promote, and blow up the various partner-brands and my invention on Social Media and on You Tube, while also cultivating new retail accounts along the way. So if you are an influencer, or Youtube-Editing Savy that would be a huge asset. The camping will include random places along the river or the coast or on lakes whenever possible, Koa's Private Campgrounds and random other friends yards or driveways along the way. 

I practice humility and respect for everyone that I meet and who is in my life. I am a Straight-In Shape Athletic Guy, and this tour and channels will blow up with the assistance of an equally attractive woman or girl, or girls along the way. This content will be shot in the context of lifestyle, and natural atmosphere and interactions. No ""posing"" or ""modeling"" just beautiful outdoor and musical vibes. So, this ad, is for the open minded, adventurous attractive one's that are out there, who are looking for something unique, and colorful and exciting to do for the next 3-6 months, perhaps longer, if you are interested in heading to Costa Rica or Bali next.

This tour will start in Florida in February and will focus on the Gulf States over the next 2-3 months and then go further from there. Please reply with your IG or any other relevant links, along with a description of why you believe you are the perfect person for this adventure. I will reply to those that seem like they would flow well.",compensation: $$ Weekly and Split of all Channel Content and Retail-Wholesale

Seeking 3 Queer/Trans/Non-binary/Female Models for Afro + Bowl Cut,"QR Code Link to This Post
            
        
I’m a licensed barbering professional seeking 3 models that are available the hours of 8:30-11AM on February 10th for hair showcase that don’t mind a total hair makeover and are okay with having makeup applied to and worn on you. 

This isn’t a big production or runway show by any means, but it is kind of the equivalent of the graduation for my salon apprenticeship. You won’t strut or have to runway walk (but you’re welcome to for the ‘gram after the presentation is over). You’ll be either seated or standing still next to me as I live cut or explain my pre cut hairstyle on you to an audience of my co-workers.

MODEL SPECIFICS:

Model 1: Will be precut between Feb. 4th and 9th. Fine/thin or medium hair density with a straight texture for a geometric bowl shape.

The position is currently unpaid but is the perfect opportunity for those looking to expand their skillset, build a portfolio, and gain access to other opportunities that will build your personal, professional brand.

Storyboard Artist for animation,"QR Code Link to This Post
            
        
Award-winning Bay Area filmmaker seeks storyboard artists. Selected artist(s) will draw storyboards for dramatic animated scenes that will be part of a documentary film covering specific events of the World War II era. 

Storyboards will first be used by the filmmaker to create ""animatics"" (edited video clips where the storyboards are roughly animated with camera moves, etc). The storyboard artist will then revise and finalize the storyboards as needed before the artwork is handed off to an animator.

First draft storyboards can be loose and rough to sort out composition issues. Final storyboards should be more refined, and must be provided as hi-res (4k or larger) Photoshop files, with backgrounds and characters on separate layers so they can be loosely animated to create the animatic.

The images included in this ad show samples of other storyboards we are using, as well as some sample style frames to give an indication of the range of animation styles to be included in the film.

Requirements:
- talent for realistic and evocative drawing/illustration, especially for use as storyboards in motion picture work
- understanding of motion picture camera angles, moves, and terminology, and appropriate use of all of these elements
- ability to use and incorporate reference materials, such as photographs, archival film footage, and clips already created by other animators working on the project
- ability to create characters and express emotion through all aspects of their depiction, including facial expression, body language, composition/camera angle, etc.
- reliability, work ethic, and ability to take direction and apply constructive feedback

While we are located in the East Bay and we may meet occasionally in person, you will primarily work from your own location.

To apply, email and INCLUDE A LINK TO A PORTFOLIO CONTAINING RELEVANT SAMPLES.","compensation: $500 per scene. There will be 5-10 scenes, and we will send you a scene to preview so you can determine the number of storyboards invovled."

Hi,

Because I live too far away from Watertown, I am looking for someone to shoot 30 seconds of 4k video of the exterior of the Watertown City Auditorium. 

This is for a dissertation project, not for commercial use. You don't need a fancy camera -- the last couple of generations of iPhones shoot excellent quality 4k video.  (It must be 4k.) I just need a straight, steady, shot of the entire front of the building. If you can shoot the interiors as well, one nice shot of the stage too would be great. 

I would like to preview the footage (you choose how) before I pay, but then will pay immediately upon receipt of the final footage.

Need VFX Artist--Rotoscoping and Screen Replacement,"QR Code Link to This Post
            
        
I hope you're doing well.

I am moving into the finishing phase of my short film. There's about 30 shots that need VFX work. Unfortunately, we could not shoot green screen on location. So, I am looking for a talented VFX artist who can rotoscope, track, do screen and background (in this case windows) replacement.

My team and I are looking to have the VFX completed for this project by March 1, 2020. 

I would also like the project files deliver, because the replaced background images are still undecided. This way I can make the decision on the final replaced image in my own time. However, it would be awesome to get started on the rotoscoping, tracking, and screen replacement. I have access to Mocha and AE. The shots very in length, the shortest shots are around 4 seconds while there are a few longer shots that are roughly 10 seconds long. 


There's three main objectives: 

1) Windows panels replaced 
2) Rotoscoping a character who is in front of a TV or window.
3) TV screen replacement 

If you're interested please send over an e-mail  with your examples of your work and I'd be happy to show you some examples of that needs to what needs to be completed.

I started my IT Managed Service Provider company last year and I am looking for someone that can focus on Sales / Business Dev.

I am open to a wide range of possibilities to fill this role including remote, but my ideal candidate will be able to take this position and bring in new clients. The more hands-on you can be the better it will work out for both of us. This position can lead to additional responsibilities and may include partial ownership in the future.

Minimum Requirements:
Cold Calling
Cold Emailing
Prospecting business leads / lists
Ability to clean up purchased lists (I buy lists of businesses from third parties and they are not always 100% accurate so you may need to do some research to clean them up and find the correct information)
General Marketing (Google Ads, LinkedIn etc.)
HubSpot CRM or similar platforms used to track sales process (I am open to recommendations or changes on this)
A quiet place to do work, a computer and a cell phone. (A dedicated home office works perfectly)

Preferred Qualifications:
+ Experience in Sales
++ Experience in IT Sales
+++ Experience in IT Managed Service Provider Sales
Ability to meet face to face with prospects
Willingness to go door to door to hand out business cards
Desire to grow with company

Work hours:
Work hours are flexible, but most of the work should be completed during regular business hours. 8 A.M. to 5 P.M. Monday through Friday

Location:
We primarily do business within the San Antonio and Austin areas, so being local will be a huge plus.
Remote work is possible, but it will be difficult to meet with potential clients and it may affect bonuses.

Compensation:
I have some ideas on compensation, but I am also negotiable on this aspect.
My preliminary thoughts are $10/hr for 10 hours per week to start with increasing tiers with each client brought on board.

Bonuses:
Bonuses will be offered for each long term contract that you sign with our company.
You can choose either the first month of the contract as a bonus or you can choose 10% of each month for 12 months.
(Example: A $1000 per month contract will give you a one time bonus of $1000 or $100 per month for 12 months totaling $1200)

There is a lot of potential and room for growth within my company and I am hoping I can find someone with the drive to help push it to the next level.

Medical news website is seeking a professional videographer who can shoot a 20-30 minute interview for us and upload the footage to our FTP after the shoot. The interview will take place at 3:30, so the approximate timing would be 3 or 3:15 to 4:15p including setup and breakdown.

I'm a photographer that's worked in NYC, SF, Cleveland, Miami and here in Jacksonville. Currently I'm looking to keep my skills sharp in Jacksonville and am looking to connect with models in the area in order to do some trade for print (TFP) shoots.

This is a great opportunity for you to get some photos created and edited by someone who's been doing this for 4+ years now and not have any additional cost to you.

My workflow consists of you first signing a model release, then we shoot. I review the photos and choose the best 10-15 for you to choose from. You choose 5 of the photos and those are the ones I edit and return to you.

You can see my work on instagram: MB85Photography or my website www.mb85.net

When responding to this casting, I ask that you include two pictures of yourself and what type of shoots you would feel comfortable doing (i.e. fashion, street, bikini, lingerie, boudoir, or something else). I ask that the pictures reflect the type of shoot you are interested in doing. 

Depending on the type of shoot, we would be shooting on location around Jacksonville or at my apartment which doubles as my photo studio setup.

If you have any questions, feel free to reach out. Thank you and I look forward to working with you!",no pay

Steelys Drinkware, a wholesale B2B sustainable product business based in San Francisco, has a contract gig for an on-site writer and product content coordinator, with opportunity to evolve into other writing and editing work.

Based in a casual, artsy, converted loft space in Dogpatch, we’re a mission-based, green-certified small business that manufactures, markets and distributes a range of drink ware and food ware products and accessories that cut single-use plastic waste. Recognized as a pioneering product innovator in the zero waste movement, we have been lucky to work with high-profile values-driven brands, progressive public policy makers and some of the leading sustainability non-profits and activist groups on the planet. Steelys has been established for more than a decade and we specialize in custom printed goods, sold in case quantities, delivering to customers throughout the U.S. and abroad.

We seek a resourceful, self-directed, creative individual for this contract web writing and content coordination project, which we anticipate will require a 2-3 month full-time or part-time commitment, depending on how we set it up and your performance.

Project will involve expanding and refreshing our digital presence and writing to market a range of new resuable drinkware and food container products. We’re in process of updating our main website to new mobile-friendly format, adding dozens of new products, and building related niche product websites.

You will conduct product research, coordinate and gather product samples, photos and information from our suppliers and factories. You will compile, edit and organize extensive product and lifestyle photography. You will collaborate with designers and our web development team, input content using WordPress template. The position could evolve beyond initial tasks and timeframe and into other assignments like writing blog posts, case studies, social media, email marketing, recruiting, and related special projects for the founder or some of the non-profit activist work we do.

We prefer candidate who can work in our San Francisco office, where it will be more convenient to collaborate with our team, review product samples, and move quickly. We might consider a candidate who works from our physical office for periodic meetings, and does some work offsite, while maintaining strict deadlines.

QUALIFICATIONS:

• B.A. in English, Writing, Journalism, Marketing or related field (or equivalent experience)

• 3+ years of experience in product marketing, writing, editing, and proofreading, developing and producing web content.

• Samples of writing product content and marketing communications. (Passion about the environment and experience writing about sustainability initiatives a plus!)

• Advanced user experience with Microsoft Office Suite (Word, Excel); Social Media platforms (Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Instagram, Pinterest); WordPress web dashboards. Familiar with the Adobe Creative Suite.

• Solid on organization and attention to detail. Self-motivated, with ability to set priorities, meet deadlines, follow direction, contribute your own ideas, and work independently in a fast-paced, creative environment.

If interested in this project, please send us an email and tell us about your experience and why you might be a good match, with resume or link to online portfolio or examples of work.

Photographer seeking older female nude model,"QR Code Link to This Post
            
        
Hello,

John Burke here. I’m a photographer in Bed Stuy, Brooklyn looking to hire a nude model for a small personal project.  

I see these aesthetically as fairly simple black and white portraits with oblique religious references. These images I want to very mildly suggestive of the virgin mary. I also plan on removing portions of limbs in post/photoshop.  I see the removal more as broken statuary rather than anything particularly grim. 

Ideally this is someone who has experience as a nude model, even better with a background modeling for figure drawing classes. Generally speaking I don’t really want to place some mental image onto another person, rather I prefer the model bring a lot of themselves to the image. Whatever form this takes i don’t know but that’s half the fun of it. 

The reason I’m looking for an older female mode is that I’ve never really seen the Virgin Mary depicted as someone older and thought that would be interesting. 

Oh one more thing. And this is very necessary for me but I do need to meetup for coffee and chat for a bit in person before taking any photos. 

My site may help get a sense myself and what I do. 

Www.johnburkephto.com


And payment. I’m not sure if it’s best to do a flat rate or an hourly rate. But I’m looking to pay $200-$300 for your time. I think it’ll depend how long we ultimately shoot for. 

Thanks for your time,

John",compensation: $200

We are a well-established (over 6 years) Sacramento-area Sketch Comedy group, looking to supplement our cast of talented comedic performers for our upcoming live sketch comedy shows! We will be holding auditions on the afternoon of Sunday, February 23rd. 

To reserve a spot at our auditions, reply to this ad with some details about yourself and your stage/comedy/performance experience. You can let us know why you’d like to join a sketch comedy group, or maybe tell us about some of your favorite comedy performers/shows or even describe your sense of humer. so we can get an idea of how you might fit with the group. 

Our group performs every three months or so at a well-known mid-town Sacramento theater. We will have our cast/writer meetings and rehearsals on Monday nights, (beginning at 7:30pm) and we ask that you be available for Monday night cast meetings/rehearsals to be a part of the group for any specific round of shows. However, we are also looking to add cast members for shows beyond the Spring (our Spring 2020 shows will be May 21-23rd) so even if you’re not available for this round of shows, feel free to audition.  

Applicants should have some stage performing, improv comedy or general performance experience. We are looking to add positive, team-oriented, professional performers with a creative open-mindedness and the ability to memorize character lines. 

Experience is important, but our cast is composed of a wide-range of talented performers from varying backgrounds and with different levels of prior comedy/performance experience, so if even you don’t necessarily have a stacked performance/comedy resume, you should feel free to come audition if you think it is something you’d like to try. You might just surprise yourself (and us!) 

Ages 18-and-up, please. 

A performance resume is not required, but would be appreciated.

Thank you for your interest. We look forward to hearing from you.

Photographer Seeks Fun Cute and Photogenic Smoking Models

I like to chill out, smoke some sticky light green bud, relax, shoot some smoking hot photos - I prefer Sexy Beachwear Type Smoking Photos, but there are many types. 

Are you outgoing, easy to talk with, do you have bright eyes, is your smile cute and inviting, do you have nice hair? - Please apply now! 

Do you have a nice looking pipe or bong that you look hot smoking? or do you smoke Blunts ?

Sexy Girls Smoking Good Bud is an art form in itself and not often appreciated. 

Beach - Park - Pool or wherever you like.

Confident or shy, outgoing or reserved, I'm easy going and never pressure anyone. I like to chill out, relax and see how great photos come together naturally. Once a model feels comfortable, that's when the art starts. 

I'm a non professional in this aspect of photography at all, though I've been shooting professional photos in other industries for over 25 years. I currently shoot with a Nikon.

Apply with some appropriate, current photos and a little about yourself.  Include your contact info, and your location.

I'm in the Poway area but I work and shoot all over SD.

Need a writer to write some stuff.  One chapter at a time.,"QR Code Link to This Post
            
        
I need to hire someone to write the scenes one chapter at a time.  If you have trouble writing the complicated stuff...that's fine.  I've already written those.  If...eventually the subject matter becomes what you're not into...that's fine...I'll get someone else's help on those.   That's a big if.   How much would you cost to write scenes as one chapter at a time?  This is a no-rush project.  Will take many bricks and a long time to finish.  Scenes in story format.

This is...due to my own short comings and excessive wasting's as an autobiographical-writer.  I'm an idea person, not an autobiographer.  Main thing is, I'm trying to tell a story, not lecture, philosophize, or complain.  Well.  No.  I HAVE.  Only, it won't sell the way it's written now.  I'll just use what I got as a platform. 

Whether you want to be called a ghostwriter or co-author, that's up to you.   A relative of mine (we're not talking) had several editors and 4 co-authors for HIS claim to fame.  Well.  How nice for him.  Anti-social charismatics have great careers.  

You must at least have a Bachelors Degree I can research.  At least.  No need to be like minded.  No one is like me.  No need to agree with everything I say.  If you don't like a part, I'll get someone else to also contribute.  (On the same token, if  you don't want to write one scene, I got plenty of others.)  Main thing is the EVENTS.  Events are...and they're impersonal.  They're events.  It's the events that make the story.  

I foresee, I'll have to get quite a few to contribute over time to finish this product.  Right now I just need one.

Videographer for Street Magician Wanted,"QR Code Link to This Post
            
        
Hi:)

I am looking for a videographer who would like to help me film quality video and audio for street magic performances. You can use your own gear or our gear or a combination of both. Whichever is best.

We have a GH5s with a Panasonic 12-38mm f2.8 II Lumix G lens, a Shure VP83 shotgun mic, Zhiyun Crane 2, and a Mavic 2.

I’m wanting to start gathering footage to make a magic special or a new YouTube channel and am looking for talented people to collaborate with. 

This would probably only be a weekend gig in our spare time. Fridays or Saturdays, days / nights. 

I would want all of the unedited footage backed up. You can edit or we can. 

This could potentially turn into a semi regular paid gig, but for now I’m just wanting to experiment, meet talented videographers / friends to collaborate with. 

I could guarantee a small fee starting out for anyone that comes out for a night, but this is more of a trial run to get started.

Feel free to email me with ideas.

Tell me about your experience in filming things like this or anything else, the gear you have, and also if you have an understanding of magic even better!

I look forward to speaking with you:)

Beauty & FX Makeup Artists - Create Gore Gags for My Short Film,"QR Code Link to This Post
            
        
Are you an L.A.-based MUA with a gift for creating some visceral makeups that should be on the cover of ""Fangoria?"" If so, I'm producing and directing a five-minute short horror/comedy script that requires some gnarly Tom Savini-esque horror FX, and looking for talent that can really sell these scares.

The script has three ""gags:"" a throat cutting, a traumatic gunshot wound where we see blood seeping through the leg of someone's pants (a cop with a gun tucked in the front of his pants accidentally discharges it), and a big chunk of meat being torn from someone's neck. I'll also need someone who can do beauty makeup for the five actors (two female, three male) in the cast.

We'll be filming on February 29th in Sherman Oaks. If you're available, please let me know (also let me know your day rate), and I'll send you a copy of the script. We can then schedule a Skype call or a phone call to talk over any questions you have.",compensation: Quote Me Your Rate

Videographer/Editor needed who LOVES Mount Tam,"QR Code Link to This Post
            
        
What is it like to be ""on Tam""?
Hi! We are a vivacious dynamic Aquarius duo (playwright/naturalists/geologist) who have written a short 5-7 minute film about the experience of being ""on Tam""as an altered state of consciousness: a state of being, a high of sorts.
It is a silly, yet serious, short live action film featuring a few different locations on Mount Tamalpais and one spot in the Marin Headlands. There should be one or two hours of shooting on a few different days so we can get the beautiful variety of weather on the MOST PERFECT Mountain. Editing and piecing film together also required. Will take references or names of friends if you have more skilled Tam fans in mind.
We are looking for someone who is FUN and sincerely HYPED on Mount Tam. Someone who can really get into the spirit of the Mountain for the shoot... someone who agrees that if you aren't on Mount Tam...where else would you be? 
Seriously.","compensation: 200 for entire shoot, infinite Tam glory."
Female Nude Figure Drawing Model,"QR Code Link to This Post
            
        
A figure drawing workshop held at the University of Hawaii, Manoa, Art Building, every Sunday, is looking for female models. Models would be posing fully nude for a group of approximately 20-25 participants in a safe and secure environment.  We are not an official UH class but have the Art Department's full support and approval to use their facilities.  This session has been running continuously at the same location for over 30 years . 

All ages, races and body types are welcome.  No experience is necessary however having an art or movement background is helpful.  Applicants are required to visit the class prior to being hired in order to get a feel for how it is run and what is expected.  The session starts promptly at 9:30 a.m. and runs till about 12 - 12:15 and pays $100 a session.  

If you are looking for steady and regular work, this is not for you.  We usually book 5-6 months in advance and are looking to develop long term working relationships with our models.  Some have been working for our group for as long as 20 years.  While we have a nice list of long term models, we are always looking to work with new people.  Our list includes both male and female, however we are trying to balance the list out as we have more male models than female.

We currently have openings for March 29,  April 26, May 3 and 24, and later into August and the rest of the year.  We will not schedule a date until the visit to the studio is completed.

For more information please reply to this ad via e-mail.  SERIOUS INQUIRIES ONLY.  RELIABILITY AND PROFESSIONALISM IS A MUST.

Good Day! :-)

Payments are made via PayPal or Venmo - This gig is ongoing! :-) I'm looking for as many people as possible that are willing to help out. :-) 

My name is Brett Vogel and I'm a singer/songwriter and I hope this message finds you doing well! I'm looking for help with promotion on Instagram to drive traffic to my Spotify page. My newest single ""I'm a Buffalo"" is about my personal struggle with addiction, but also about HOPE! Can you help spread the word by sharing ""I'm a Buffalo"" on your Instagram stories? I know there are many people out there just like me that struggle with addiction and depression. I believe the song can help people feel as if they're not alone. :-) It's already helped many others. Music helps people heal. :-) Music is also the universal language. I'm grateful for you and your time. Please help me out if you can. 

Job requires you to share the song on your Instagram stories via the Spotify APP. It's a simple two clicks and literally will take less than 20 seconds. I'm asking for 3 shares a week for 3 weeks so this comes out to $20.00 for a couple minutes of your time. 9 shares total. :-) I also have 30 other songs, so you may share other songs you like as well instead of sharing ""I'm a Buffalo"" each time. I'm really looking for new friends, and like minded people to connect with. If this song and message resonates with you, I'd be grateful to connect and meet you! :-) PLEASE LISTEN TO THE SONGS BEFORE RESPONDING. Will the songs resonate with your friends? Do you resonate with the message?

In other words, if you have 10 followers and have only made 2 posts to your instagram profile you probably aren't a great fit. If your followers primarily listen to rap or hip-hop or heavy metal you may or may not be a good fit.

Ideally you're: a college student studying film with a good amount of filming and editing experience, a love of comedy, exceptional organizational skills, social media savvy, and an overall creative.

This starts immediately - as early as tonight, January 25, 2020. You MUST have your own equipment. This is a paid and on-going position, ideal for a college student with free time during the evenings to attend/film shows.  Please reply with:

-your experience filming and delivering quick turnaround videos for IG/YT
-your interest in comedy
-your thoughts / any relevant viewpoints on increasing the reach of a comedian via social media
-proof of your organizational skills
-intangibles you think you bring to the table",compensation: $50 - $100 per week / 5 - 10 hours per week max

Hi All.

I'm looking for a swift app developer, who is in between projects and available immediately, to build an app with me for a percentage of the income it generates.

I'm not looking for someone to work for free, but rather I believe people should be fairly compensated for their work.

I work a regular job, and don't have $20,000 to drop in advance, but I'm willing to invest my time in the project, because I believe it will be a game changer. 

The feedback I have received so far has been pure excitement, and I am thoroughly convinced that once you hear the details of my idea, you will absolutely be as excited and driven as I am.

If you are willing to provide me with examples of your work and sign an NDA, I will disclose the details to you and we can discuss an agreement of the amount of time we will both contribute and what our take will be.

I am a project manager by trade, and already have a UX consultant 100% committed. I want to keep the team small and dedicated.

The necessary skills would be Swift coding, database management, and hyperparameter optimization.

Please respond and include examples of your work and a list of relevant skills and/or a resume.

Webcam model partner wanted!,"QR Code Link to This Post
            
        
Looking for an open minded, nice, professional, but most importantly attractive (personality included) and driven individual that stands out.

I'm an attractive, smart, early thirties male looking for an open business relationship that would include you wanting to break into the webcam modeling industry. If you need details about what webcam modeling is, Google is your friend.

Requirements:
- Females only
-Under 40, over 21
-You must be attractive (obviously this is subjective, but not overweight, pretty face, good body (not necessarily athletic or ""perfect"") as this is a MODELING gig
-Any height is fine
-You must be open to suggestions
-You must be a people pleaser. Cam modeling is mostly about having people like you
-Preferably not in a relationship, but definitely not in one where you're significant other is going to be an issue
-All races are ok, but I'm a white guy
-Any height (I'm tall, 6'3"")
- modeling experience prefered but not required

Pictures of me provided after secure, non scammy contact is made. Keep in mind this is in no way an add for prostitution, because that's a no go, and it's also illegal. This probably shouldn't amount to being anything other than business partners.

So...

Send your pictures of you looking cute to the email contact provided. Females only over the age of 21 and below age 40. Cute clothes are fine, but no nudity or anything crazy. In fact if you're sending nudes to a random email address, don't. It's not smart. Please avoid trying to send ""premium"" anything, as it will be ignored.

If you're interested in starting a premium Snapchat or site, that can be discussed as well.

 All equipment for shooting is already provided by me (laptop, gigabit internet, webcams, video camera, other nerd things, blah blah.

Every attempt possible will be made to keep your anonymity, but the model industry by nature is generally not anonymous. You use fake names of your choosing (similar to dancers in a club), and block IP addresses from the states you do not want people watching you in. If someone finding out you are a cam model would ruin your life or your career that you care about, I'd advise not doing it. There is always a risk of someone finding out, although I try to minimize it.

Again:
If you are a hooker, prostitute, whatever... this ad is not for you. I don't participate in prostitution and don't support it.

Have a wonderful day, and contact me with any questions.",compensation: 50/50 compensation for both of us based solely on tips and content sold (negotiable)

I am in need for transcription of about 100 articles from PDF publications.  The publications are from the years 1910s - 1930s, and the articles cover reports of evangelical missionary work in China. The articles vary in size, from a few hundred to a few thousands words.

The services would require transcribing the PDF news article content into MS Word format, putting all articles into a single Word document.

Must keep news articles in chronological order, beginning with the earliest. 

Includes writing publication citation in MLA format for new article. 

Accuracy and quality is important.

Copy and paste is unlikely to be a viable path for getting the content into MS Word.

The turnaround time is not urgent and can be mutually agreed upon. 

The news publications are in PDF format and will be provided in a ZIP file. As best as possible, the relevant sections to transcribe are highlighted. See attached images for examples. Note that the highlighting starts and stops. The highlights are directional, pointing to the article to be transcribed. The expectation is that the whole article is transcribed, and the highlights are just to help recognize the relevant article. 

Since the articles vary in size, it is not clear what the total word count / line count / etc. to be expected or the duration of the work.

Please reply back with relevant experience, WPM typing speed. References may be requested.

You're within 35 miles of CHI and moderately computer literate.,"QR Code Link to This Post
            
        
90% of the intent of this ad is for a paid gig that must be close to Chicago.  I define ""close"" below.  For those of you nowhere near Chicago, I might as well mention my software apprentice gig; I say a bit more at the bottom.


THE MUST HAVES FOR THE CHICAGO PAID GIG

The Chicago paid gig is to digitally (computer) record several Chicago TV channels.  I know how to do this, but I need someone near Chicago.  Specifically, your distance from downtown Chicago is bounded as such:

1. If you're within the broadcast area of at least the 4 national, commercial affiliates (ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox), that would be great.  That almost certainly works within 30 miles, probably 40 miles, maybe 60 miles, and hypothetically 100 miles, but 100 miles is probably way too far.  The more channels and the closer and the stronger signal, the better.  If you're on the borderland, we can look at the FCC maps, and you may know what you can get, and we can otherwise discuss.

2. If you're outside broadcast but in the Chicago cable TV zone, you'd have to have a clear QAM cable signal.  My research so far is that those are becoming rare.  We can discuss / research if need be.

3.a. We have people near downtown Chicago but without the tech knowledge (see below).  If 
you can go to Chicago to set up and then when something breaks, that might work.  

3.b. Similarly, if you have someplace you can host a recording computer within the broadcast zone, that might work, as long as you can get to the computer as needed.

OTHER MUST HAVES

The basic requirements involve very few hours a week or month.  There is more possible work involved, though, which I list below.  

The gig is ongoing in that we hope to record ""forever.""

The computer needs to record at least 17 - 19 hours a day, and it probably makes sense to just leave it on 24/7.  It needs to be connected to an antenna, although not necessarily a big one.  Thus, moving the computer is risky.  You could start off with a laptop but you probably couldn't use it as a mobile laptop.

You'll have to swap out hard drives perhaps as often as every 10 days.

You'll probably have to mail USB drives and / or Blu-rays and / or entire hard drives every few days.  If you're close enough to downtown Chicago to hand-deliver them, great.  (This is one of several factors that I haven't mapped out completely.  My best estimate is the upload speeds to avoid snail mail would be hard to get.  We can discuss if need be.)

As I mentioned, we already know people in the broadcast area.  My concern is that they would be useless as soon as something breaks.  So you need to be technical enough to troubleshoot with my remote help.  

Similarly, eventually I'll probably need to get into the computer remotely.  If that waits until you're using a ""company"" computer, that's fine.  Thus, you may need to open up firewall ports: port forwarding or pinholing.  (Or we might be able to use UPnP.  My research hasn't gotten that far.)  That's also the sort of thing that folks we know can't do.

See my note about communicating in writing below.

REALLY NICE TO HAVE

If you have a computer we can use / rent from you to start out with, that would be great.  Eventually we'll probably send you or pay for you to build a ""company"" computer.

On that point, if you can pick out a used computer for us to pay for and / or get paid to build one, that would save me the trouble of doing so and sending you one.

Running Linux would make my life easier.  Linux within Virtualbox or such may work.  I run Ubuntu, but the distro probably doesn't matter.


EXTRA WORK

If you want to do some basic video editing on an ongoing basis (for pay, of course), that would be great.  I hadn't done it until this project, so I can tell you for a fact that it doesn't have to be pro grade, and I can (hopefully) teach you based on what I did.  It took me 2 - 3 hours to learn well enough including eliminating 2 pieces of editing software.  Now I know what works.

There is another line of work, or at least one, you could do within this, but I don't want to give away all the secrets in a public ad.  Remind me to discuss.


PAY

Pay is negotiable.  I wish I could be more specific, but we haven't done this before, there are a lot of if-then-elses, and I can't quite envision the exact workflow.  We can go through in detail what is needed and then you have a basis to tell us what you want.  I've ""done this"" enough to prove it's doable, but not on an ongoing basis, so, again, there are aspects I haven't mapped out.


""I"" versus ""we""

I hate it when people nebulously use ""we.""  I am the tech guy of this project.  There is also a money lady.  The money lady is a Georgia Tech civil engineering grad, so no tech slouch.  So that's why I switch between I and we.  Also, I hope some of you will be thrilled that it's the tech guy posting the ad and filtering the responses.
  

ONE MORE MUST - WRITTEN COMMUNICATION

I'll add one more must-have qualification, with the approval of the money lady.  You must be comfortable communicating in writing.  I'm the typical to somewhat extreme geek type who is not in a hurry to talk to strangers on the phone.  Also, I am older than the culture of instant communication.  I'd rather substance over speed.  You don't have to answer me immediately on your phone.  In fact, it's probably best never to write me on your phone--at least not until we know each other--it tends to annoy me.  If you don't own a real keyboard--at least a laptop--that almost certainly eliminates you just on communication grounds.

Also, I've suffered a number of times in life because I got on the phone too quickly.  I can tell a lot about someone from a few emails. I make judgement mistakes about someone on the phone that I probably wouldn't by email.


SOFTWARE APPRENTICES

Those of you who look at CraigsList (inter)nationally may have seen my ~15 - 20 software apprentices ads in Atlanta computer gigs, going back to 2013 or so.  I'm still in Atlanta, but I don't care where my apprentices are.  The apprentice gig would be unpaid.  The payment would be learning marketable skills.  Beyond that, that's not the focus of this ad, so ask for more if you want.  I figure anyone who has read this far may pass my written com test.",compensation: negotiable
