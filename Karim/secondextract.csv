We are looking Towards a New Future
Our company focuses on private tours in Los Angeles that satiate the emotional needs of the heart rather than the intellectual needs of the brain. It's no longer enough to purchase travel services as we move along in our day to day life, we want a story to go along with what we buy as well. It is no longer enough to just see the world for what it appears to be, it is now about being able to touch, taste, and experience the world for what it really is by interacting and communicating with individuals in a new light.

Participant Needed For IRB Approved Psychological Research Study,"QR Code Link to This Post
            
        
‚Ä¢	Are you a female between the ages of 18 and 20? 		
					
‚Ä¢	Have you had an active social networking account on Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Tumblr, or Reddit, for 
        at least 2 years? 	
									
‚Ä¢	Have you used a social networking account to engage in behaviors like excluding, teasing, harassing, or 
        threatening someone over the past 12 months on social media or some other form of digital networking 
        (regardless of how well you knew the person, if your identity was anonymous to them, or if you acted as a 
        part of a group)? 
 								
If you answered ‚Äúyes‚Äù to each of these questions I am interested in scheduling a telephone interview with you to find out more about your methods, thoughts, and emotional reactions to behaving aggressively online. Your feedback will be kept confidential and is important to help mental health professionals better understand the phenomenon of cyber-aggression.

 This interview should last approximately one hour.  However, additional follow-up questions may be required to elaborate on your personal experience. The information that you provide during the telephone interview will be recorded and analyzed for themes that will then be compared with other participant‚Äôs answers and entered into a comprehensive final written report that will include direct quotes to illustrate the conclusions of the study.  Any identifying information (e.g. names, profile names, etc.) provided in your responses during the interview‚Äî including those of third parties‚Äî will be given a pseudonym, altered, or removed to protect your confidentiality. Also, all contact with me will only be by telephone or email to help protect your identity.  An active email address and a working telephone number will be required to participate in the study and to collect your e-gift card. You are encouraged to use an email address that does not include your actual name and a telephone number that does not have a personalized voicemail message if you decide to use your own contact information and would like to remain anonymous. You will not have an opportunity to change your responses once the interview is over (unless prompted by follow-up questions) so please take your time to carefully think about your responses before answering questions. Complete and usable interviews will receive a $20 gift card to a store of your choice that offers email delivery. For example, Amazon, Best Buy, Forever 21, iTunes, Sephora, Starbucks, Target, Ulta, or Walmart. Any correspondence after the interview is over will be delivered to the preferred email address that you will provide during the prescreening process.

This study is not intended as a therapeutic intervention. Although there is a relatively low risk of harm for your participation, it is difficult to predict what emotions, thoughts, personal insights, or new understandings the interview questions might activate. If you would like to discuss any unpleasant reactions triggered by your participation in this study with a mental health professional, a list of cyber-aggression/victimization and crisis support resources will be provided to you after your completion of the interview or by sending a request, at any time, to the email address provided, below. Participants who on a rare case-by-case basis need therapeutic intervention as a result of any kind of psychological distress from participation in this study will have an opportunity to meet with a licensed clinical psychologist, Patrick Petti, Ph.D. for one free session and will be provided with referrals to other licensed mental health professionals, if necessary.

"Competent coder needed asap JS,PHP,PYTHON: pick any two ;)","QR Code Link to This Post
            
        
So, our stack is designed with a focus on scalability and extreme modularly (largely JS but a touch of php, python, and a couple of .net api endpoints).  In short, we love tech. 
For us, this means we like to use whatever gets the job done best...I suppose this defines us as 'Tech Agnostic' to a certain degree...


YOU
You are a competent coder.  By this, we mean you either live,love or work building web sites.

You are not tense or too rigid - team cohesiveness is a must-have.

Ideally, you have undeniable full stack MEAN JS mojo - or at least intimately understand how to create an end-to-end implementation.  

However, a strong JS-PHP (ajax, etc) background could be considered as well if it came attached to a smart, eager to learn (FAST) candidate ;)

And finally, along these same lines, if you are a python virtuoso and want to swing by, chat a bit over a coffee / beer and convince me that you could build the pieces we need more effectively with python, i would be happy to have that conversation ;)



US
Sigh, yes, in this bay area bubble, we are technically just another post-concept, post-(modest)-funding, pre-seed startup.  But, being in tech for 20 years, after two successful startups - i can say with confidence that this concept has what it takes (incl much financial interest) to become a MAJOR internet destination by the end of 2020.  

We are no frills, scrappy & all about creating the best product - extremely quickly.  So...if you are looking for kamboucha on tap or manicures between meetings - this is not a fit. 

So, if you have the chops and are, at worst, looking for a quick paid gig ... and at best, looking for somewhere you can learn from, grow into and end up having a sizable contribution to for months or years to come - reply ASAP with:

1) name / number / email /
2) How many years in dev / of what kind?
3) payment requirements
4) resume / online portfolio / links to examples of past work - and this next part is important - PLEASE INCLUDE  DESCRIPTIONS OF YOUR INVOLVEMENT IN EACH PROJECT
(lists of links will be ignored...)

We will be deciding pretty quickly so don't take long to respond...

Promotion Street Team for a Movie Filmed in Rogue River,"QR Code Link to This Post
            
        
Hello everyone!

As many of you may have seen over the past couple of months, there has been several casting calls for a feature length horror movie posted here on craigslist. We wrapped up our first shoot and have recently launched a Kickstarter for our film titled, Piglady.

We are looking to create a street team to help promote the Kickstarter and spread the awareness about the movie.

The people in Rogue River and the surrounding areas have been a tremendous help bringing this project to life, but as you probably know too well, the weather in Oregon is subject to change at any moment. This created some challenges with filming, much of our shooting had to be delayed due to rain and snow.

We will have to come back for a second filming, this is why we decided to create a Kickstarter to help generate the extra budget needed to do a second shooting.

If you'd like to help promote, please follow us on Instagram and reach out to us on there. Also, the most important part is sharing the Kickstarter link anywhere you can imagine.

There is a teaser video showing some of what we filmed and it will give you a better idea of the movie we are creating!

Thank you!

Female Models Wanted -athletic/swimwear- Unique Opportunity inChicago!,"QR Code Link to This Post
            
        
Hello Chicago!

Welcome to Midwest Calendar Models!


I'm working with a modeling agency based in Florida and Arizona, who are looking for models that are based out of Chicago or grew up in the Midwest. If you are looking to market yourself and build your portfolio, then this opportunity is for you!

This is a unique opportunity to showcase your talents, build a portfolio, AND make a bit of money on the side!

I am looking for attractive female models to model some branded athletic apparel and/or swimwear. The photo shoot will take place in an apartment in Old Town with a professional photographer. I am offering $120 for this photo-shoot. Each session is anticipated to last between 1-2 hours.

In addition to the $120, I'm offering 20 edited pictures. If you want video too, I can provide that as well.

You may be wondering why I'm offering all of this. Its pretty simple: I would like to grow my relationship with modeling agencies across the country. I'm eventually going to market these services, and more, to models on a paid basis. But like with all new businesses, I need to develop a referral list and body of work to present to the modeling agencies.

Also, don't be mislead by the pics in the ad, as they are just sample pics, since I'm looking for models of all colors, shapes, and sizes. In fact the more variety of the models the better I can market you and myself to the agencies.

So with all that said, if you‚Äôre an aspiring model living in the Chicago area (or have easy access to the city), and you are looking to make a little money and build your portfolio, then send me your contact info to midwestcalendars@yahoo.com

By the way, you MUST be at least 18 years old, and a have valid photo ID, and you must be able to make it to the Old Town area of Chicago.

This is a professional offer, so please treat it as such, you must be there at the agreed upon time.

Please don't bother contacting me if you don't meet this criteria.

Again if you're interested and you think you qualify (for either athletic wear and/or swimwear, and again I am looking for all shapes and sizes), please send me your info to midwestcalendars@yahoo.com",compensation: $120 Per photo-shoot plus 20 edited photos

My name is Vella. I am a strength and conditioning coach in the Easy Bay. I am looking to start a team of woman with a beautiful look to transform their bodies into their ideal dream figure. I am seeking female models who wish to achieve a more aesthetic look and take their bodies to an instagram worthy level. My approach will have a heavy glute and leg focus.

actors for a scene work group (not a class),"QR Code Link to This Post
            
        
I'm a director and former actor, looking to form a group with actors and work on 2-3 person scenes.  We'll take turn picking the scenes.  If any of the actors are also writers or directors, we'll work that in.  As we go, if we want to build up to a small-theater show or put scenes on camera, that's what we'll do.  It may work best to work intensely during weeks when people are free, and then skip other weeks entirely.

I'm certainly open to meeting a group of actors that already does group scene work.

If you've ever put an ad up on c/l, then you understand how it makes more sense for the original poster to be anonymous.
If people will send a reel and resume, I will reply likewise, and you can get back to me if you also think we have a good fit.

I have some training in directing actors from several teachers whose names you may know, but I'm not an expert myself.  I'm a bit of an Uta Hagen fan, but not an expert on her either.

Ideal partners for me would:
‚Ä¢ be trained in stage and screen acting, and have broad interests
‚Ä¢ use a range of tools, inside-out and outside-in, and not just one technique
‚Ä¢ believe that at certain points in the process, acting involves thinking (and not just intuition/feeling)
‚Ä¢ be a bit accomplished, and need a workout more than they need a class
‚Ä¢ want/need some give and take, and not just for me to craft them

RSS Feed to Push Notification iOS/Android App,"QR Code Link to This Post
            
        
This is a remote gig.

I'm going to lay out all the details in advance so that you may find out if this is a good fit for you and provide an estimate in your first reply.

The app will be incredibly simple, with no user settings whatsoever. They simply install the app or delete the app. The only feature will be that it sends a Push Notification to their phone every time there's an update to the RSS feed, which will be a single and fixed URL that is already live and functional (so you don't need to build anything for that).

That's it.

Other than that, it should be completely bare-bones. No tracking or analytics of any kind, no registration required, no ads, etc. It will be a completely free and open source app under GPL or public domain. I'll need the iOS version and the Android version; I'll provide the icon and any other graphics required. You'll provide me with the source code and the submission-ready versions of each, which I'll submit to Apple and Google myself, which means they need to be compliant with their guidelines in order to be approved.

If you have more questions before you can provide an estimate, I understand, but at least try and provide a ballpark so that we don't waste each other's time if the price isn't a good fit.

If you are interested please send a recent picture showing your hair. We are looking for guys who have medium-length or longer hair, so if you already have short hair or are balding, you're not quite right for this project.

To reiterate-- we are looking for guys who are okay with having their hair cut really short, if not bald. If that is not something you are open to, you might not be a good fit.

Thanks!",compensation: Rate depends on your hair

I'm looking for a cofounder for my next startup or app.

I want to make it a company along with open sourcing the software behind it.

I‚Äôm not wanting to create a system heavily influenced on Wordpress, where you can change themes add plugins, products and blog system.  The system is more like www.AVVO.com but not for lawyers.  And that is all I can disclose to you now.

People would upload their themes where the static website is stored and the API would take care of where the main styles are pointed to control themes.

I'm am a veteran in business and law, but not a veteran software engineer or experienced with my own startup.  I've worked in various startups as an advisor that I was not a founder of as well.

Apple computer maven sought to assist wife and self on our computer journey in Lagunitas. Scope of work is very basic, mainly helping my wife get over her techno-anxiety, organize her Mac and learn to use basic tools like Skype and Dropbox. Also, to access apps on her iPhone. It hasn't been her priority, even though she was a filmmaker, and she's of a certain age now, so this role will call for some patience and charm. 

I occasionally have questions as well.  

Please email me with qualifications and rate.

NEED TALENTED TECH WRITERS AND PRODUCT REVIEWERS,"QR Code Link to This Post
            
        
Hey Craigslist!

We're seeking passionate individuals looking to write about technology; specifically, product reviews, hands-on previews and evaluations, and anything else related to the wide world of tech. We're looking for writers able to follow-through with assignments, attend industry tradeshows, and show a willingness to work with a team of like-minded individuals.

Please note this is NOT a full-time position; compensation will almost exclusively be via product samples, media access, and other fun stuff. Keep this in mind before replying.

What We‚Äôre Looking For:

Our ideal candidate is someone with a grasp of consumer technology, emerging trends, and more than a basic interest in the latest products. This could be anything from the latest in computer hardware, audio and video equipment, peripherals and accessories, smartphones, smart living, software and more.

You don‚Äôt have to know everything about tech but demonstrating a willingness to learn goes a long way. Solid writing and editing skills in English are a must; college degrees don‚Äôt matter if you can‚Äôt produce readable text.
We work closely with several of Silicon Valley‚Äôs biggest companies and our criteria for any applicant is simple: don't be crazy, have talent, and be willing to learn. This is an ideal position for budding writers hoping to establish both a foothold in the industry while expanding their resumes with a reputable website.

Other duties may include participating in group podcasts, access to industry events, and other media-only presentations. Compensation varies by assignment and skill level; our goal is someone able to talk and produce content fast and efficiently. You won't get rich, but you will learn valuable skills and gain incredibly helpful experience in the process.

NOTE: absolutely no spammers will be considered. We‚Äôre not looking for want aspiring actors/actresses, photographers, models or professional social-media marketers. NO SEO CONTENT MILL writers will even be considered. We're only interested in writers hoping to review, talk about, and discuss tech only. Troll messages will go right to the spam folder.

This isn't a full-time position and compensation will almost exclusively be product samples, media access and resume-building. If this sounds like you, great! Reach out ASAP with relevant information like your resume/CV or writing samples (at least) ‚Äì emails saying ‚Äúsend more info‚Äù will be deleted straight away.

Also - make sure to send your email address so we can reply to you as Craigslist often hides this. Reach out to us ASAP and let‚Äôs see if you have what it takes.",compensation: compensation depends on assignment

Feature seeking Student/Beginner VFX Artist,"QR Code Link to This Post
            
        
Hello CL,

I am the post-producer for a low budget feature and I am seeking VFX students or beginners who need some footage on their reels.

We have about 80 shots that need small touch ups, of which we would give you 5 or 10, as we are planning on farming out the shots to multiple people (we have already given the 10 most difficult shots to an experienced VFX artist). 

We need touch-ups such as: changing the times on clocks in the background, removing wires and boom mics that snuck into frame, removing certain words on signs in the background, etc. Most of the film is handheld, so experience with/knowledge of motion tracking is a must.

This is intended to be unpaid work, although if you are willing to take on a good number of additional shots, we can negotiate a stipend.

The deadline for any shots you take on would be April 2.

Please respond with reels (they do not have to be extensive, after all, we know you're just starting out) and any inquiries. Thank you.",no pay

x Song reviews
x Album reviews
x Interviews
x Editorial content
x Open pitches

THE PITCH

Our definition of country music is wide, spanning bluegrass, Americana, mainstream and more. 

My ideal writers are people who fucking love country music, but also have a complicated relationship with it. They're people who are willing to kick the genre's tires and take a look under the hood. 

For this gig, ""fit"" is equally important as writing and reporting talent.

PLEASE APPLY IF

o You're cool being edited (a lot).
o You're willing to collaborate (yes, even as a freelancer).
o You're interested in examining country music critically.

Please do not apply if: 

o You're looking for a transactional gig.
o You don't like being edited.
o You work as a publicist. 
o You ONLY know radio country. 

THE PAY

This is a paid freelancing gig. All articles will have an agreed rate prior to assignment (by piece for reviews and by word for features and editorials), payable upon publication. We also pay a kill fee (for features and editorials only).

Looking for women to start an exotic dancers business,"QR Code Link to This Post
            
        
I am starting an adult entertainment business and need women who are sexy, smart, funny and capable of working with other women. I need women that are ready to take a chance at what will most likely become a very profitable opportunity. I plan on starting an exotic dancer business with many other ways of generating income, like shooting and recording picture and video to market. Not only will you be able to make money from your shoots, but you will also be creating your own portfolio to use as a resume if you would like to try and further your career in the adult industry. I am located at the very top of the state of Maine and understand that relocating is a must for this to work out. It is small towns where I am but don't let that stop you. It is beautiful country, a safe and peaceful place, full of bored men willing to spend their money on sexy women. It is also a great place to raise children to all of you moms out there that could be using their bodies, sensuality, sexual prowess and knowledge of how to attract men, to make some good money. Moms, I can offer good clean free housing until I get you your own full apartment with everything included. You pay nothing! This is not a lie... I can provide free housing with shared living until I can get you your own apartment at no cost, everything included! If you need a change of scenery and want to become a part of this business I'm starting, you won't be disappointed. You have my guarantee that if you change your mind at any point, I will accommodate you and take full responsibility to get you to wherever you want to go. No contracts, this is a business I am starting and I want it to be in full partnership with all employees. Free to go, free to do as you please. There will be plenty of opportunity to advance in this career that is hard to make a go of and make good money. My plans are pretty simple... Start this adult entertainment business legally, so that the women I have working with me can earn as much as possible, legitimately. I would like to find a woman or women that can help me start this from the ground up, creating a website together and helping me make this venture the best it can be. It will take some time to get everything figured out and situated, but there will be money to be made from day one and I am willing to support you until you can support yourself. The cost of living up here in Northern Maine is very low, for example, rents are anywhere from $300 per month. As the provider of this business, I want to make sure that anyone working with me has everything they need without having to spend their hard earned money. It may sound like a risk to take since I need models before opening the actual business(which won't be hard), but I assure you, I will do whatever it takes to make sure your needs are met and if you want to back out at any time, I will immediately get you where you want to be, even if that's across the country. I will move you here to join me and I will move you back to any part of the country you would like to go. I want this business to be ""employee owned"" although I want it to be a full partnership for all models willing to work with me. This means, all models will be named on the business as full partners and will have complete say over day to day operations, along with the choice to take out loans against the business for whatever you would like. I am a very loving, caring and understanding man. I don't like to get angry in general and will NEVER treat you unfairly. I promise to be the easiest person to be a part of this business    with, as I have the most respect for ALL women and love to do the best I can to please others. None of this is out of despair. It comes from years of knowing that I should be doing this for a living. 
With all of this being said, you should easily see why I haven't started the business before finding the models... I want the first women to join me to help me create the entire business, from the ground up. If needed, I will start this business with just the models as owners and just make myself an employee to you. This is how much faith I have that this is going to be a successful venture, I've already done a lot of math on this. 
So, PLEASE, don't hesitate to contact me about all of this with plenty of questions. I have a couple of good lawyers to make sure I have no choice but to stand by what I offer, if that's needed on your side. If you have the body and the looks, I don't care what your past was! Get in touch with me! Moving to Northern Maine might be what stops many of you, but stop and think... If done right, you can earn plenty of money to perform for a month and go back home for whatever amount of time as you need. You should be able to continue making money while you are away with the many ways of generating money we will be dealing with. I'm open for opinions and hope to get some decent responses. Thank you for your time and consideration.","compensation: Once operating fully, there'll be no limit to what you make"

BOOK SHOW PRESENTATION
I'm the only living member of the household where Michael Jackson first started his Homeschooling. 
Our lifelong  commitment of International Redemption and spiritual illumination, was to follow our 50 year commitment of silence protecting families from our knowledge of career criminals and mercenaries whose blackmail of a group of teenage boys was discovered by Law Enforcement. 
Who inducted their parents into a sting and sent the teenagers away for their protection. Together these parents and the FBI secretly brought the International crime ring to justice. None of them aware that the young boy they had pulled out of a junior officers academy  was overhearing every word of their debriefings through an intercom system set up by the teenagers they'd sent out of state.
Michael Jackson and I were  taught self-hypnosis to forget what we'd been exposed to. When my mother who was our home-school teacher discovered this by overhearing us talking about it. 
 Michael Jacksons parents were led to believe, that I was more deeply influenced by the criminal mentality of my older mentally ill brother than I was. In order to facilitate the process of mine and Michael's permanent separation for our 50 year commitment to witness protection. 
The truth was, that my parents shared secrets of our Ancestors with me that not all family members could be trusted with. and from that point on. I was working as a volunteer officer in the official witness protection program and so was Michael Jackson. Known only by top clearance officials on a need to know bases.

Living with my mother, after I'd left my Father's home and the influence of his PTSD. I became the teenage Counselor for victims of dehumanization in human trafficking, abusive homes, attempted suicides, drug addiction and  overdoses. Under the direction of my Mother, the Officer and Counselor, while being closely scrutinized by the Sacramento, County Sherriff's Dept.  

This severe environment was all the more reason to keep the homeschooling and expulsion of me and Michael Jackson silent. Michael and I were on a mission as separated spies working together while he was on the Ed Sullivan Show in 1967 until the end of his life on June 25th, 2009. 
Protecting the teachers and their families who'd covered up their own crimes  in their attempts at protecting their families from gang violence. was the reason we were expelled and started homeschooling in the first place. Something to complicated to interject into the beginning of the JACKSON 5's critical start up in Show business.

The teachers would've been exposed to gang violence had our parents insisted the teachers admit the fight Michael and I were expelled for was justified by their failure to act in my defense. Choosing instead to leave me in harms way for standing up, which they were too scared to do. Ignoring my asking for help by siding with the teacher against the bullying students whose parents were members of a ruthless street gang.

So you see. In all reality, Michael Jackson was a secret agent for the FBI from the age of 7 years old, till the day he died. 
We may never know all the reasons God decided. It was too much too soon to let that become part of his justification during Michael's trial's in the 1990's and my narrow escapes from those who opposed our reunion.
Maybe it had to do with our next mission in witness protection. The one me and Michael qualified  my parents' and I for in 1970 only because my older brother was gone and again involved with outlaw's. That's when we housed an endangered family member of the most influential member of the largest motorcycle gang in America in order to protect her life during the most infamous Biker Trial of the century. 

A mission not possible, had Michael or I not been found of sound responsibility in our roles, protecting the Teachers who'd set us up and the Officer's whose covers would've been blown had we not accepted and committed to our mission. Regardless of the extreme circumstances, conditions and pressures that we both endured as children in the first 4 years of our 50 year commitment as volunteer officers.
Perhaps it had something to do with the 50 year commitment thing. 
After all, it seems interesting to me that it was 4 years after International Publication that I first started getting offers about turning THE MOON BROTHER's into a motion picture.
I was forced to give up singing during our 50 year commitment. So it had been 50 years since I had sung when I started writing and speaking out. After heart surgery which was performed on June 25th, 2013.
That's also when I started singing again after 50 years.
It's taken me till my 60's, after 14 years of collage work, to get to the point of fully understanding what Michael Jackson was saying to me, at  7 years old, as if he was born knowing it. 
In 1966, at 7 years old. (before the Ed Sullivan Show) Michael Jackson said:
""Our story, because of all those involved, who they were, how long ago it started, and how long it will go on. Will make too many movies to count, and be worth more money than either one or both of us could possibly make in our lifetimes. Even though I will become as famous as Elvis Presley""","compensation: Nondisclosure, Time Based percentage, commission, & profit sharing."

Facebook Account Rental,"QR Code Link to This Post
            
        
Hello! We are looking for United States based individuals who do not use their facebook accounts that often and are looking to, essentially, rent the advertising side of their profile.

Facebook has two sides to it. The personal side full of news feeds and cat photos, and then the advertising side that is hidden behind the scenes.

Recent changes to Facebook's algorithm have made it more and more difficult to keep advertising accounts open, even though we only run compliant, vanilla ads.

Because of this we have had to turn to various communities to find volunteers to rent their profiles out to us.

You may have seen the ""make money from your Facebook account"" ads... this is the same thing.

If you are interested, the job entails just sticking with us while we get everything set up behind the scenes, and then that's it. It's a set and forget, you may continue using your Facebook account as before. We operate behind the scenes and even though everything that we do is compliant, legal and ethical, you won't see anything on your side.

We respect you and your privacy. This is the easiest set and forget income/job you can find.

Again, US-based accounts only. Your age or gender does not matter. Depending on Facebook account age we would be willing to compensate you anywhere from $50-500/month sent directly via PayPal.

Thank you!",compensation: $50/month+

Hello!

My company, Grid Media Group, is looking to hire a few 20-30 somethings, both male and female, to pose for a few corporate stock photo-type pictures that we'll be using for a web project. I should note that any models involved in this shoot would not be able to use the photos we take in their portfolios, but it is a paid job.

We are based in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania and the photoshoot would probably take about 2-3 hours. We're thinking a lot of the photos will be in the sort of theme you can see in these mood boards:
