"_______PRODUCTION DESIGNER WANTED FOR PILOT","QR Code Link to This Post                    I used to make a show called BLANKET FOLK. It was virtually no-budget. I'm making a legit looking pilot of it now, which will be shopped around via connections & friends of mine. Here's the most recent thing I made. It got picked up for distribution by Night Flight. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7HxFLxociEI don't need an expert (and likely cannot afford one), but more so am looking for somebody who is good at taking an average looking space, and sprucing it up. In a fantasy realm, you're a person totally capable of making Pee Wee's Playhouse or Mighty Boosh style sets. My expectations are not quite so high due to budgetary constraints, but so long as the feeling is there...If you want to check the tone of the show, feel free to reference the old episodes: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB1rCwLKcAghttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l02s7mU7MY&t=16shttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqESsOob7rA&t=39sI'm open to renting/buying v-flats and whatever else is needed, but it would be great to find somebody who has a truck, flats, supplies, etc. that can just include them as a line item on their invoice.  One location is an actual residence that needs re-dressing. Another will be a warehouse, wherein I need to fabricate 3  sets. (a torture chamber, a hospital room, and a prison cell). Bonus if you think you can design some cool torture racks. I have no idea what somebody would charge for this, as I'm a novice, but to give you some perspective - the budget for the entire project (not including post) is under 30K, and will likely be around 20-25. Please respond with some kind of images of things you've made. They don't have to be actual sets. I'm open to hiring an amateur/aspiring designer here. I just want somebody who makes cool looking stuff. At the end of the day, I just want somebody who's a good visual artist, who also happens to be sort of handy, or feels like than can make a room look really cool.I almost always re-hire people I've worked with before, but I'm new out here, and I've also never had the budget to hire somebody for this position in the past. Hopefully I'll find someone, and I can hire you for all my film projects.

This project is for an escape room. The room tech will lead the clients into the room and push a button that will start a video. The video will explain the rules of the room and then a timer starts counting down. When all the puzzles are solved and the escape door is opened it releases a second button that will pause or stop the video. This will let the tech know and be able to record the exact second the room was solved because of where the time on the video has stopped.I am very computer literate I am just unfamiliar with this stuff and would be faster if someone could lead me through it. I need someone in the area that can physically come and program the pi onsite, demonstrate that it works, and teach me how to switch out the video if i ever want to update as well as explain/guide me on the process of setting it up if it doesn't work automatically once its programmed. I even have some recipes from pi programmers that are suppose to work using python3 and omxplayer so a majority of the programming is already written and it all just needs to be plugged together.

You don't need to be an experienced screenwriter, but you do need to bring the real-world expertise for one of the following separate projects:Project 1) Psychologist with some experience in experimental psych- bonus points if you have knowlege or interest in ethics boards, suggestibility, satire, or horror/weird fiction.

I'm thinking of the general ballpark of The Naked City, or The Big Heat, or Touch of Evil, among other movies like Point Blank from 1967, Zodiac, Memories of Murder et cetera.
