Hi, I'm looking to build a small crew of creative and technical professionals in the field of small video production.

I'm a one-man band myself (most of the time). I'm primarily looking for those with  at least one year of experience as a videographer and cinematographer and someone who is truly interested in gaining experience and improving their knowledge base. Don't worry, I don't ask people to work for free. However, I also can't pay *too* much ($15-$20/hr, depending on experience/knowledge). So I'm probably targeting individuals with maybe 1-2 years of related work experience and interest. Looking for people I can work with maybe 3-4 times a month for generally small production jobs. 

The good thing is, I shouldn't ever really need your gear as I generally have enough equipment for most jobs.

I'm just looking for 2-3 people who:

- Have experience with DSLR cameras (and Blackmagic)
- Have a SOLID understanding of the exposure triangle and the important of white balancing.
- Have decent sense of framing.
- Understands importance smooth tripod movement and stillness. 
- Has edited their own work (you learn most of your shooting mistakes when having to deal with your footage)
- Can think on their toes and make adjustments as necessary.
- Have an understanding and some experience with audio field recorders, lav mics, boom mics and basic technique with all of this equipment.
- Basic understanding and experience of 3-point lighting and working with light stands, sandbags, softboxes, reflectors and diffusers.
- Positive attitude! This a tough one because negative people don't always know they're negative.
- Knows how to remain calm under stress.
- Leaves their ego at the door. If you have a chip on your shoulder or feel life owes you more than it's given you, I'm very much not interested in you.
- Tries to keep busy themselves with other work and is constantly learning to become better at what they do.
- Must live in L.A. (in the valley is a plus)
- Has reliable mode of transportation.
- Photography experience is a plus.
- Light Meter experience is a plus.
- Experience with Adobe Premiere Pro is a plus.
- Experience with Adobe After Effects is a plus.

I'm really just looking for people who are easy to work with, have an innate interest in this kind of work and have some foundation of knowledge. Everything else, I can teach. I'm sure there's a few things you could teach me too.

Please feel free to respond by telling me about yourself, your background, and any work you might have to show."

I’m a licensed barbering professional seeking a prompt and reliable model that is available in Chicago February 10th for a hair showcase that doesn’t mind a total hair makeover and is okay with having makeup applied to and worn on you. Ideally someone with open availability on Mondays. 

This isn’t a big production or runway show by any means, but it is kind of the equivalent of the graduation for my salon apprenticeship. You won’t strut or have to runway walk (but you’re welcome to for the ‘gram after the presentation is over). You’ll be either seated or standing still next to me as I live cut or explain my pre cut hairstyle on you to an audience of my co-workers.

MODEL SPECIFICS:

Bowl Cut: Will need to be precut between Feb. 4th and 9th. Model will also need to be present 2/10 from 8:30-9:30 for presentation. Fine/thin or medium hair density with a straight texture for a geometric bowl shape. Must have a full head of hair that reaches jaw or chin level with no undercuts or outgrown fading but okay with going very short. Must be ok with wearing makeup. No gender preferences. No size preferences. MUST HAVE THE RIGHT HAIR. Non-negotiable.

INTERESTED? FOLLOW THESE INSTRUCTIONS:

If interested, reply with little bit about yourself and an image of you in your favorite outfit to help me figure out what to style you in for the presentation. Any clothing or accessories I may have to get for models will be yours to keep as a thank you. Please be sure you’re available the full time 8:30-9:30AM 2/10 for the presentation.

"HAIR MODELS NEEDED - ORIBE HYBRID CUT MODEL - WEDNESDAY 2/5/20

QR Code Link to This Post
            
        
Hi there--

GMLV Casting (formerly Gilleon Smith + Extra Mile Casting www.gmlvcasting.com) here, and we are working with Oribe (https://www.oribe.com/) on an upcoming hair cut demonstration. Models will be used to demonstrate the new ""Hybrid"" cut.

See Specs Below:

The “hybrid” is a freeform approach of working with hands and razor to create movement and reduce bulk. The “hybrid” cut is a mix of two popular Oribe cuts; the graduated bob and the signature short. The length will vary, however this cut will range from a shorter “graduation cut” hair style which is a little edgier and has a little more layers and volume than a classic bob to being short on the back and sides of the head and slightly longer on the top. Models MUST be willing to have their hair cut, and be flexible with what length the hair will be. The overall length of the cut is also flexible based on the hair type, texture, and the preference of the model, but usually ends up chin length or shorter exposing the nape of the neck, with a little more hair on the top and sides. Models should have short to medium length hair.

Hybrid Model Cut Requirements:
Must be okay with the hybrid haircut
Short to Medium Length preferred - *Bobs (any length) or Longer
Fine to Medium Density
Curl Type 1A-3B
Wavy, curly, not too coarse but open to some texture
Existing Bangs Okay
Existing Bob Okay
No Existing Pixie Cuts
No Extensions
No Microbangs
No Undercuts
*Bangs are optional but not mandatory*


Please follow the below instructions to be considered:

**Verify that you can be fully available for WEDNESDAY, 02/5/20
**Please Also Verify (even if you have provided this info for us in the past):
-Full Legal Name:
-Date of Birth/Age Range:
-Current Height:
-Current Weight:
-Phone Number:
-Email Address:
-Union Status:
***PLEASE READ CAREFULLY- IN ORDER TO BE CONSIDERED
You MUST send CURRENT photos of the front + back of your current hair style as well as a photo of your side profile. You MUST send the required photos to be considered for the event.
-Please send a couple of CURRENT / candid digital / selfies of yourself is possible. Please also send any artistic/modeling/headshot.

As soon as we get that information, we will review and get back to you with further instructions.

We look forward to hearing from you, it’s going to be a fun day!

I need a LOCAL, Mpls/St.Paul Twin Cities, Wordpress/hosting/front-end dev expert, to modify code for a redesign of my website. I need someone local who knows WordPress and front end development VERY well. HTML5/CSS3/JS

This is what I'd like to accomplish, if you think you're up to it (the last two devs I worked with failed):

• I have my own domain and website which I have been maintaining myself for 10+ years (I'm a UX Designer).

• It's a small site, with just 4 static pages. One of the pages (just ONE), I would like to be a blog driven by WordPress. The other 3 pages are static html that I will edit, maintain, ftp, etc on my own. 

• I gave previous developers access to my web-hosting account to see if WordPress in a directory (e.g. ""blog.html or /blog/blog.html"" could be hooked up to achieve this. Is this impossible? I use Bluehost as my hosting provider. If changing providers (ugh) is a solution, I'm open to that option. 

• There is some extra code (SASS, LESS, SCSS) which isn't necessary for such a simple site and I would like it extracted. And some small misc user interface (CSS) tweaks that need implementing.

• I have a detailed proposal document that outlines exactly what I'm looking for which I can provide.

• LOCALS ONLY -  I need to meet at a coffee shop wherever in the Twin Cities area to discuss and look at the code in person. If you aren't able to MEET IN PERSON, please ignore this message."

"Are you a helpful business savvy assistant with 10 hours a week ?

QR Code Link to This Post
            
        
Hello there!

I have a new role as a Business Broker and I need your help with quite a few things. You are great at details, systems, common sense and are looking to master a role where you will be effective and appreciated.  My long-term goal is to build a socially conscious business brokerage supporting Entrepreneurs locally through selling their business and globally through providing micro-finance to people who don't have access to capital otherwise. 

It's a humble beginning, I myself am working an additional job until my new role becomes profitable. Right now, it’s expensive hobby but I am getting a lot of client interest so there is great potential. To get there I need someone much more detail oriented to organize my efforts. I'm the typical Entrepreneur, idea person, etc.

Are you a match? Here is a breakdown of what you are great at and don’t worry I do train as well:

Client Relations/Project Manager: Keeping in touch with sellers and buyers as to the status of their transaction (also to other service professionals such as the clients Lawyer, Accountant and more) 1-2 times a week until the deal closes. You will also be requesting information such as tax returns from different parties ( and sometimes 4-5 times until they send it, keeping track of who needs what). 

Working with others: Once trained you will manage a team of two full time remote workers for me and work with 3 appointment setters at my company from time to time. This project management consists of less than one hour a week as most of their work is on their own. You are mostly just making sure that they have everything that they need and are scheduling correctly.

Systems: Take what you know, what you learn from me and organize my operations and marketing manuals. You are great at incorporating those items as we go into action steps. Think of this like a Franchise manual on Google docs.

Basic Administrative: Help me order business cards, manage third party vendors like Google, Calendly, etc. Manage my schedule helping me think of “next steps ahead” as I can get distracted on the short-term things.

Research: Effective business research and reports when I first meet with the business owner and then organizing a presentation to sell the company once they list to sell. This includes recasting financials which requires 100% accuracy in numbers and working with the owners to organize their paperwork

A personal touch: I would like for you to hand address sales letters.

Your Schedule: Starting out with about 10 hours a week with potential with more hours if we both shall like. Looking for someone to mostly work independently from a place of your choosing but local enough to meet in person.

Can you help? If yes, why work with me? 

My goal is to enjoy the process of working together long-term. I am flexible and treat people well. I’m a start-up of a start-up so the initial hourly pay won’t be the highest but if you stick with me it will work out for you. I'm thinking $14-$20 an hour cash depending on your skills and generosity. Make me an offer. Your work has the power to help Entrepreneurs sell their business, many of which have major health challenges and really need our help. That in turn will support other Entrepreneurs globally who have no access to capital. 

To show that you read the ad and are good at details, reply with:
1) What prompted you to respond and why are you a good potential match to work together?
2) What do you know about Tim Ferris and what my goals are related to the way he thinks?
3) How is your handwriting?
4) What are your short- and long-term career goals and how does this role play into it?
5) Resume or Linkedin is optional

Happy 2020!!"

"Brett Vogel - Singer/Songwriter - Help on Spotify & Instagram

QR Code Link to This Post
            
        
Good Day! :-)

Payments are made via PayPal or Venmo - This gig is ongoing! :-) I'm looking for as many people as possible that are willing to help out. :-) 

My name is Brett Vogel and I'm a singer/songwriter and I hope this message finds you doing well! I'm looking for help with promotion on Instagram to drive traffic to my Spotify page. My newest single ""I'm a Buffalo"" is about my personal struggle with addiction, but also about HOPE! Can you help spread the word by sharing ""I'm a Buffalo"" on your Instagram stories? I know there are many people out there just like me that struggle with addiction and depression. I believe the song can help people feel as if they're not alone. :-) It's already helped many others. Music helps people heal. :-) Music is also the universal language. I'm grateful for you and your time. Please help me out if you can. 

Job requires you to share the song on your Instagram stories via the Spotify APP. It's a simple two clicks and literally will take less than 20 seconds. I'm asking for 3 shares a week for 3 weeks so this comes out to $20.00 for a couple minutes of your time. 9 shares total. :-) I also have 30 other songs, so you may share other songs you like as well instead of sharing ""I'm a Buffalo"" each time. I'm really looking for new friends, and like minded people to connect with. If this song and message resonates with you, I'd be grateful to connect and meet you! :-) PLEASE LISTEN TO THE SONGS BEFORE RESPONDING. Will the songs resonate with your friends? Do you resonate with the message? Also, maybe you are an artist yourself and don't care about the money and just want to help a fellow artist. We're all human and all need help sometimes. :-) 

Listen to ""I'm a Buffalo"" on Spotify - https://open.spotify.com/album/5A5teeEkiy25sRbGbrGIVv?si=THcnyymOQp2A2nwWc_hLig

Instagram - http://www.instagram.com/brettvogelmusic Instagram handle is @brettvogelmusic - Follow me here to connect. 

Payments are made via PayPal or Venmo - This gig is ongoing! :-) I'm looking for as many people as possible that are willing to help out, however, I only prefer to work with people that connect with the music/message and aren't sharing just for the money. :-) I will assess your Instagram profile to see if you are a good fit for the job. In other words, if you have 10 followers and have only made 2 posts to your instagram profile you probably aren't a great fit. If your followers primarily listen to rap or hip-hop or heavy metal you may or may not be a good fit. My fans enjoy similar artists like: Hozier, Coldplay, James Bay, Dave Matthews Band, David Gray, Van Morrison, Ed Sheeran, Jeff Buckley, Bruce Springsteen, Ben Howard, Bon Iver, and many others..."

I am a tv show creator/writer/producer. 

I have written a scripted historical drama tv series inspired by true events set in New York City, Lower East Side.

The series uses as a scaffolding/structure a number of true/legitimate historical events, including among them never-fore-unmasked issues/connections regarding President Theodore Roosevelt, his administration AND the impact of certain key/inciting incidents by the show's co-female protagonists that played a major, and never before credited connection to his administration and a lasting impact by these events on the country still felt in contemporary American society. 

There are other key events of this ""never before told story"" that are easily ""google-able"" AND which have a high web presence and huge viral visibility. 

In addition to the actual episodes I have written for the show/series, I have also created an academic/thesis style paper that reflects these never-before revealed historical incidents. My paper is 44 pages long. Another 20 pages includes addenda regarding the actual tv series that sets the complete stage for the academic/historical incidents that are braided into the dramatic story. 

HERE IS THE JOB/TASK REQUIREMENT

I am seeking a Wikipedia Pro/Writing Expert conversant in the described arenas/genres described above (and below)...

AND....

Using/taking my ""academic/thesis"" paper, along with other ""factual data"" using this info and then cross-referencing/citing MY academic/factual discoveries and integrating/adding the elements of my paper/tv show (for which there is an extensive and fabulous (presently unpublished website, we are not ready to go public with) AND have YOU integrate OUR facts/history, etc. into the webisphere adding OUR show info (facts/history based) ON and INTO other Wikipedia Sites that specialize in these historical niches that the show addresses, that will then drive traffic to, and link back to our show website and all other social media. 

If you have proven expertise in Wikipedia, consider yourself a historical-enthusiast, OR, even better, are an academic/scholar with expertise in early 20th century history (story is set in NYC 1900), sub-niche exposure to President Theodore Roosevelt, Feminism, Feminist Movements, Jewish Feminism/ists, Early Jewish History, Early New York City/Lower East Side history, AND CAN WRITE.... then perhaps you might find this gig interesting. 

Please respond with appropriate info - including of course, resume/cv that demonstrates all the above required abilities. Links, writing proof/samples, etc essential.   

This is a once-in-a-lifetime gig, we are looking for a one-in-a-million candidate/person that can and will immerse themselves in both the excitement and gravitas of this incredible opportunity.  We are posting this in NY, LA, Boston, Chicago and Miami; the creator/writer lives in South Florida."

We are doing our first promo ""We"" I. E. One Dude, and Several Attractive Girls) (one girl one dude next week)  at one of the Springs around the Orlando Area.  I have Go-Pros, but it would be nice to add another camera angle, and or some drone footage to the shoots.  This tour is multifaceted, primarily focusing on the plugging of  several outdoor products, including my invention which is a mobile camping shower., as well as a sweet line of sunglasses, and a disc golf company and a kayak-tubing company so far. (E Bike-E Scooter and Water Scooter Partners pending) 

We are going to layer the promo videos with general camping-van life as well as festival life. Ideally we would like to procure a partner with the skills (on the editing or the photo-video side of the fence) to edit or shoot random videos and photography with us.  We have a very minimal budget presently, but as the channels grow, the partnership-sponsorships will grow as well.  (more funds for everyone) So the real mission is to blow our You Tube and IG and various other SM channels up and make this a huge success ($$$ and Followers and DL's combined) 

If you happen to have an outdoor or festival product of your own, then we could of course intertwine that into the mix.  The colors of these channels will be good, pure, happy-adventurous vibes, no drugs, or alcohol or negative language.  There is also swag (High End Sun Glasses being one of them) available for anyone involved. Eventually We aim to cover all Festival Fees, or at least a portion of them, once the Channels Start Generating enough income.

Bay Area Freelance Front-end Developers,

I will help you get hired as a full-time developer at a big company like Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google, LinkedIn, or a medium sized company like Box, Personal Capital, Nordstrom.com, or a startup—whatever you’d like.

In the mean time, I can give you small freelance gigs for some extra cash and help with your resume, your portfolio site, the recruiter dance, technical interview coaching, and compensation negotiation.

What’s in it for me is that you help me get freelance development work done that meets my standards. I’ll help coach you to learn those standards in a casual, easygoing, way.

As much as you might need a full-job, it’s not going to happen right away—it’ll probably be weeks of prep and hustle.

Requirements:
1. You must have years of professional developer experience.
2. You might call yourself a mid-level front-end developer.
3. You live in the Bay Area or have plans to move here.
4. You’re hire-able.
5. You’re coach-able.

If everything above aligns with what you want, send me an email and tell me how you meet all the requirements—and please include your email address and freelance availability.

The series uses as a scaffolding/structure a number of true/legitimate historical events, including among them never-fore-unmasked issues/connections regarding President Theodore Roosevelt, his administration AND the impact of certain key/inciting incidents by the show's co-female protagonists that played a major, and never before credited connection to his administration and a lasting impact by these events on the country still felt in contemporary American society.

"HISTORIAN / SCHOLAR - NYC, LOWER EAST SIDE / WIKIPEDIA PRO/WRITER PRO

QR Code Link to This Post
            
        
I am a tv show creator/writer/producer. 

I have written a scripted historical drama tv series inspired by true events set in New York City, Lower East Side, 1900.

The series uses as a scaffolding/structure a number of true/legitimate historical events, including among them never-fore-unmasked issues/connections regarding President Theodore Roosevelt, his administration AND the impact of certain key/inciting incidents by the show's co-female protagonists that played a major, and never before credited connection to his administration and a lasting impact by these events on the country still felt in contemporary American society. 

There are other key events of this ""never before told story"" that are easily ""google-able"" AND which have a high web presence and huge viral visibility. 

In addition to the actual episodes I have written for the show/series, I have also created an academic/thesis style paper that reflects these never-before revealed historical incidents. My paper is 44 pages long. Another 20 pages includes addenda regarding the actual tv series that sets the complete stage for the academic/historical incidents that are braided into the dramatic story. 

HERE IS THE JOB/TASK REQUIREMENT

I am seeking a Wikipedia Pro / Historian - Academic / Scholar / Writing Expert conversant in the described arenas/genres described above (and below)...

AND....

Using/taking my ""academic/thesis"" paper, along with other ""factual data"" using this info and then cross-referencing/citing MY academic/factual discoveries and integrating/adding the elements of my paper/tv show (for which there is an extensive and fabulous (presently unpublished website, we are not ready to go public with) AND have YOU integrate OUR facts/history, etc. into the webisphere adding OUR show info (facts/history) and include these bits of new and fascinating historical information/discoveries ON and INTO other Wikipedia Sites that specialize in these historical niches that our research AND the show addresses. The point of this exercise is that this will then drive traffic to, and link back to our show website and all other social media; all of this will create high level, highly credible awareness for our tv show/series and unmask this valuable educational information for a wide ranging audience. 

If you have proven expertise in Wikipedia, consider yourself a historical-enthusiast, OR, even better, are an academic/scholar with expertise in early 20th century history (story is set in NYC 1900), sub-niche exposure to President Theodore Roosevelt, Feminism, Feminist Movements, Jewish Feminism/ists, Early Jewish History, Early New York City/Lower East Side history, AND CAN WRITE.... then perhaps you might find this gig interesting.

Hello! 

I’m a camera operator and DP looking to build my reel. I have a alexa mini camera package with lenses, steady cam and an assistant available on February 15th, and am looking to shoot an artist performing in the forest. 

Footage will be intercut with some other footage previously shot for a scrapped project, I can send a link once we get a conversation going.

I’m paying for gear / crew / food, so this is a great opportunity for a musician and fellow artist who maybe can’t afford a $5k-10k music video budget but needs some visual content. Artist/performer will just need to supply their own outfit and transportation, and be able to lock in the date 2/15 this week. Unfortunately I can not afford to pay the artist, but you will walk home with a polished music video, and I’m covering all shooting costs! 

Let’s make some art!

This is for a client of mine and I will not be able to be available the whole day so I want someone to be able to help with the transition while I am not present. I will work with you in the morning to get things started. I will expect you to be able to make useful suggestions as needed once I present the plan. As I said it is a simple migration but I want to make sure it goes smoothly.

It is a WP installation with just a couple of Plug ins and add on features. There are a max of 30 pages.

Basically we are doing the following:

1. Registering domain after TPP unlock by previous dev.
2. Setting up new site to host, installing WP
3. Importing site data to new site.
4. Managing and monitoring DNS propagation progress.
5. Testing all links, forms, email addresses that are used on site.
6. Testing again. Debugging.

I am only hiring local developers, meaning within 1 hour of SF. Only individuals, not teams or companies.

Please email back if interested whether you are available this coming Wednesday, and what experience you have with this type of migration and all the issues that might arise. There will be other work if this goes well.

Please put in the SUBJECT line of the email the following so I know you can follow directions:
""Tokushoryu""

Thanks in advance!"

It is no longer enough to just see the world for what it appears to be, it is now about being able to touch, taste, and experience the world for what it really is by interacting and communicating with individuals in a new light.

"Participants Needed for IRB Approved Psychological Research Study

QR Code Link to This Post
            
        
•	Are you a female between the ages of 18 and 20? 		
					
•	Have you had an active social networking account on Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Tumblr, or Reddit, for 
        at least 2 years? 	
									
•	Have you used a social networking account to engage in behaviors like excluding, teasing, harassing, or 
        threatening someone over the past 12 months on social media or some other form of digital networking 
       (regardless of how well you knew the person, if your identity was anonymous to them, or if you acted as a part 
        of a group)? 
 								
     If you answered “yes” to each of these questions I am interested in scheduling a telephone interview with you to find out more about your methods, thoughts, and emotional reactions to behaving aggressively online. Your feedback will be kept confidential and is important to help mental health professionals better understand the phenomenon of cyber-aggression.

     This interview should last approximately one hour.  However, additional follow-up questions may be required to elaborate on your personal experience. The information that you provide during the telephone interview will be recorded and analyzed for themes that will then be compared with other participant’s answers and entered into a comprehensive final written report that will include direct quotes to illustrate the conclusions of the study.  Any identifying information (e.g. names, profile names, etc.) provided in your responses during the interview— including those of third parties— will be given a pseudonym, altered, or removed to protect your confidentiality. Also, all contact with me will only be by telephone or email to help protect your identity.  An active email address and a working telephone number will be required to participate in the study and to collect your e-gift card. You are encouraged to use an email address that does not include your actual name and a telephone number that does not have a personalized voicemail message if you decide to use your own contact information and would like to remain anonymous. You will not have an opportunity to change your responses once the interview is over (unless prompted by follow-up questions) so please take your time to carefully think about your responses before answering questions. Complete and usable interviews will receive a $20 gift card to a store of your choice that offers email delivery. For example, Amazon, Best Buy, Forever 21, iTunes, Sephora, Starbucks, Target, Ulta, or Walmart. Any correspondence after the interview is over will be delivered to the preferred email address that you will provide during the prescreening process.

     This study is not intended as a therapeutic intervention. Although there is a relatively low risk of harm for your participation, it is difficult to predict what emotions, thoughts, personal insights, or new understandings the interview questions might activate. If you would like to discuss any unpleasant reactions triggered by your participation in this study with a mental health professional, a list of cyber-aggression/victimization and crisis support resources will be provided to you after your completion of the interview or by sending a request, at any time, to the email address provided, below. Participants who on a rare case-by-case basis need therapeutic intervention as a result of any kind of psychological distress from participation in this study will have an opportunity to meet with a licensed clinical psychologist, Patrick Petti, Ph.D. for one free session and will be provided with referrals to other licensed mental health professionals, if necessary.  
Please direct any questions or requests regarding participation in this study to cyberaggressioninterview@gmail.com 

Best Regards, 
Katherine Bregar, MA, Graduate Student,                                                                         	                                            Alliant International University,                                            		                                  Cyberaggressioninterview@gmail.com

"Competent coder needed asap JS,PHP,PYTHON: pick any two ;)

QR Code Link to This Post
            
        
So, our stack is designed with a focus on scalability and extreme modularly (largely JS but a touch of php, python, and a couple of .net api endpoints).  In short, we love tech. 
For us, this means we like to use whatever gets the job done best...I suppose this defines us as 'Tech Agnostic' to a certain degree...


YOU
You are a competent coder.  By this, we mean you either live,love or work building web sites.

You are not tense or too rigid - team cohesiveness is a must-have.

Ideally, you have undeniable full stack MEAN JS mojo - or at least intimately understand how to create an end-to-end implementation.  

However, a strong JS-PHP (ajax, etc) background could be considered as well if it came attached to a smart, eager to learn (FAST) candidate ;)

And finally, along these same lines, if you are a python virtuoso and want to swing by, chat a bit over a coffee / beer and convince me that you could build the pieces we need more effectively with python, i would be happy to have that conversation ;)



US
Sigh, yes, in this bay area bubble, we are technically just another post-concept, post-(modest)-funding, pre-seed startup.  But, being in tech for 20 years, after two successful startups - i can say with confidence that this concept has what it takes (incl much financial interest) to become a MAJOR internet destination by the end of 2020.  

We are no frills, scrappy & all about creating the best product - extremely quickly.  So...if you are looking for kamboucha on tap or manicures between meetings - this is not a fit. 

So, if you have the chops and are, at worst, looking for a quick paid gig ... and at best, looking for somewhere you can learn from, grow into and end up having a sizable contribution to for months or years to come - reply ASAP with:

1) name / number / email /
2) How many years in dev / of what kind?
3) payment requirements
4) resume / online portfolio / links to examples of past work - and this next part is important - PLEASE INCLUDE  DESCRIPTIONS OF YOUR INVOLVEMENT IN EACH PROJECT
(lists of links will be ignored...)

We will be deciding pretty quickly so don't take long to respond...

"Promotion Street Team for a Movie Filmed in Rogue River

QR Code Link to This Post
            
        
Hello everyone!

As many of you may have seen over the past couple of months, there has been several casting calls for a feature length horror movie posted here on craigslist. We wrapped up our first shoot and have recently launched a Kickstarter for our film titled, Piglady.

We are looking to create a street team to help promote the Kickstarter and spread the awareness about the movie.

The people in Rogue River and the surrounding areas have been a tremendous help bringing this project to life, but as you probably know too well, the weather in Oregon is subject to change at any moment. This created some challenges with filming, much of our shooting had to be delayed due to rain and snow.

We will have to come back for a second filming, this is why we decided to create a Kickstarter to help generate the extra budget needed to do a second shooting.

If you'd like to help promote, please follow us on Instagram and reach out to us on there. Also, the most important part is sharing the Kickstarter link anywhere you can imagine.

There is a teaser video showing some of what we filmed and it will give you a better idea of the movie we are creating!

Thank you!

I’m looking for a possible local, if not no big deal. 

I’ve got a project I’m wanting to work on with a back end developer that I want open source for any other developers to use in the future.

I want to create a headless CMS system that’s based on Wordpress but make it graphql compliment. As there is a rise on static site generators like gatsby that let you call on apis to display content. I’m thinking there is a good market for a fully fledged admin panel based CMS system. I want to make it a company along with open sourcing the software behind it.

The reason for that is to allow developers who don’t want to maintain the updates can just used the api we create for it and they just login to use the management system. 

I’m wanting to create a system heavily influenced on Wordpress, where you can change themes add plugins, products and blog system.

People would upload there themes where the static website is stored and the API would take care of where the main styles are pointed to control themes. 

If anyone else has ideas or are interested in helping shoot me a message. I’m pretty ambitious I’d like to get my idea up off the ground."
"Female Models Wanted -athletic/swimwear- Unique Opportunity inChicago!

QR Code Link to This Post
            
        
Hello Chicago!

Welcome to Midwest Calendar Models!


I'm working with a modeling agency based in Florida and Arizona, who are looking for models that are based out of Chicago or grew up in the Midwest. If you are looking to market yourself and build your portfolio, then this opportunity is for you!

This is a unique opportunity to showcase your talents, build a portfolio, AND make a bit of money on the side!

I am looking for attractive female models to model some branded athletic apparel and/or swimwear. The photo shoot will take place in an apartment in Old Town with a professional photographer. I am offering $120 for this photo-shoot. Each session is anticipated to last between 1-2 hours.

In addition to the $120, I'm offering 20 edited pictures. If you want video too, I can provide that as well.

You may be wondering why I'm offering all of this. Its pretty simple: I would like to grow my relationship with modeling agencies across the country. I'm eventually going to market these services, and more, to models on a paid basis. But like with all new businesses, I need to develop a referral list and body of work to present to the modeling agencies.

Also, don't be mislead by the pics in the ad, as they are just sample pics, since I'm looking for models of all colors, shapes, and sizes. In fact the more variety of the models the better I can market you and myself to the agencies.

So with all that said, if you’re an aspiring model living in the Chicago area (or have easy access to the city), and you are looking to make a little money and build your portfolio, then send me your contact info to midwestcalendars@yahoo.com

By the way, you MUST be at least 18 years old, and a have valid photo ID, and you must be able to make it to the Old Town area of Chicago.

This is a professional offer, so please treat it as such, you must be there at the agreed upon time.

Please don't bother contacting me if you don't meet this criteria.

Again if you're interested and you think you qualify (for either athletic wear and/or swimwear, and again I am looking for all shapes and sizes), please send me your info to midwestcalendars@yahoo.com"

Hi,

My name is Vella. I am a strength and conditioning coach in the Easy Bay. I am looking to start a team of woman with a beautiful look to transform their bodies into their ideal dream figure. I am seeking female models who wish to achieve a more aesthetic look and take their bodies to an instagram worthy level. My approach will have a heavy glute and leg focus. 

This is an aggressive program designed to make the most progress. 

Joining the team:

This is a 3 month commitment
Clients meet for individual training 2-3x week
Clients agree to a meal plan and supplementation that is tailored to you, your body, and your restrictions
All girls meet 3x a month for high intensity group training
Clients agree to be recorded during workouts and are welcome to record and take photos as well. 

No matter where you are starting from, there is always room to grow and improve. A fitness lifestyle not only transforms our bodies, but changes the way we think and feel. Allowing us to bring the best versions of ourselves to our next gig or photoshoot. 

About me, I am a former model with a huge passion for fitness and working with people who have an eye for beauty. 

This is not a paid job but a great opportunity to work with someone who shares the same passion and goals.

Please text me for more details - 408-613-9740"

QR Code Link to This Post
            
        
I'm a director and former actor, looking to form a group with actors and work on 2-3 person scenes.  We'll take turn picking the scenes.  If any of the actors are also writers or directors, we'll work that in.  As we go, if we want to build up to a small-theater show or put scenes on camera, that's what we'll do.  It may work best to work intensely during weeks when people are free, and then skip other weeks entirely.

I'm certainly open to meeting a group of actors that already does group scene work.

If you've ever put an ad up on c/l, then you understand how it makes more sense for the original poster to be anonymous.
If people will send a reel and resume, I will reply likewise, and you can get back to me if you also think we have a good fit.

I have some training in directing actors from several teachers whose names you may know, but I'm not an expert myself.  I'm a bit of an Uta Hagen fan, but not an expert on her either.

Ideal partners for me would:
• be trained in stage and screen acting, and have broad interests
• use a range of tools, inside-out and outside-in, and not just one technique
• believe that at certain points in the process, acting involves thinking (and not just intuition/feeling)
• be a bit accomplished, and need a workout more than they need a class
• want/need some give and take, and not just for me to craft them

Thank you!"

"RSS Feed to Push Notification iOS/Android App

This is a remote gig.

I'm going to lay out all the details in advance so that you may find out if this is a good fit for you and provide an estimate in your first reply.

The app will be incredibly simple, with no user settings whatsoever. They simply install the app or delete the app. The only feature will be that it sends a Push Notification to their phone every time there's an update to the RSS feed, which will be a single and fixed URL that is already live and functional (so you don't need to build anything for that).

That's it.

Other than that, it should be completely bare-bones. No tracking or analytics of any kind, no registration required, no ads, etc. It will be a completely free and open source app under GPL or public domain. I'll need the iOS version and the Android version; I'll provide the icon and any other graphics required. You'll provide me with the source code and the submission-ready versions of each, which I'll submit to Apple and Google myself, which means they need to be compliant with their guidelines in order to be approved.

If you have more questions before you can provide an estimate, I understand, but at least try and provide a ballpark so that we don't waste each other's time if the price isn't a good fit.

Thank you!"

I’ve got a project I’m wanting to work on with an experienced or talented student developer that
I'm looking for a cofounder for my next startup or app.

I want to make it a company along with open sourcing the software behind it.

The reason for that is to allow developers/Companies/Advertisers who don’t want to maintain the updates can just used the api we create for it and they just login to use the management system, with an option for premium access account and pop up ads to users as well.

I’m not wanting to create a system heavily influenced on Wordpress, where you can change themes add plugins, products and blog system.  The system is more like www.AVVO.com but not for lawyers.  And that is all I can disclose to you now.

People would upload their themes where the static website is stored and the API would take care of where the main styles are pointed to control themes.

If anyone else has ideas or are interested in helping shoot me a message. I’m pretty ambitious I’d like to get my idea up off the ground.

I'm am a veteran in business and law, but not a veteran software engineer or experienced with my own startup.  I've worked in various startups as an advisor that I was not a founder of as well.

I'm interested in consumer, enterprise, mobile, web, developer productivity, consumer, and finance. I also have an interest in AI / machine learning and data mining/analytics although I haven't had much direct experience in the past.  The UX is important, too.

I've got a couple of ideas at a consumer / programmer producitiviy blend I'm currently looking to develop and discuss. But I'm open to other possibilities.

Hint: You will need a clean PDF from your book designer, one without crop marks or the “draft” watermark, and which includes the front and back cover in their proper location in the file (i.e., at the beginning and end). Your book designer will know what to do. Unless you own a professional version of Adobe Acrobat, you will not be able to edit your book PDF to add the cover pages.

QR Code Link to This Post
            
        
Hey Craigslist!

We're seeking passionate individuals looking to write about technology; specifically, product reviews, hands-on previews and evaluations, and anything else related to the wide world of tech. We're looking for writers able to follow-through with assignments, attend industry tradeshows, and show a willingness to work with a team of like-minded individuals.

Please note this is NOT a full-time position; compensation will almost exclusively be via product samples, media access, and other fun stuff. Keep this in mind before replying.

What We’re Looking For:

Our ideal candidate is someone with a grasp of consumer technology, emerging trends, and more than a basic interest in the latest products. This could be anything from the latest in computer hardware, audio and video equipment, peripherals and accessories, smartphones, smart living, software and more.

You don’t have to know everything about tech but demonstrating a willingness to learn goes a long way. Solid writing and editing skills in English are a must; college degrees don’t matter if you can’t produce readable text.
We work closely with several of Silicon Valley’s biggest companies and our criteria for any applicant is simple: don't be crazy, have talent, and be willing to learn. This is an ideal position for budding writers hoping to establish both a foothold in the industry while expanding their resumes with a reputable website.

Other duties may include participating in group podcasts, access to industry events, and other media-only presentations. Compensation varies by assignment and skill level; our goal is someone able to talk and produce content fast and efficiently. You won't get rich, but you will learn valuable skills and gain incredibly helpful experience in the process.

NOTE: absolutely no spammers will be considered. We’re not looking for want aspiring actors/actresses, photographers, models or professional social-media marketers. NO SEO CONTENT MILL writers will even be considered. We're only interested in writers hoping to review, talk about, and discuss tech only. Troll messages will go right to the spam folder.

This isn't a full-time position and compensation will almost exclusively be product samples, media access and resume-building. If this sounds like you, great! Reach out ASAP with relevant information like your resume/CV or writing samples (at least) – emails saying “send more info” will be deleted straight away.

Also - make sure to send your email address so we can reply to you as Craigslist often hides this. Reach out to us ASAP and let’s see if you have what it takes."

Hello CL,

I am the post-producer for a low budget feature and I am seeking VFX students or beginners who need some footage on their reels.

We have about 80 shots that need small touch ups, of which we would give you 5 or 10, as we are planning on farming out the shots to multiple people (we have already given the 10 most difficult shots to an experienced VFX artist). 

We need touch-ups such as: changing the times on clocks in the background, removing wires and boom mics that snuck into frame, removing certain words on signs in the background, etc. Most of the film is handheld, so experience with/knowledge of motion tracking is a must.

This is intended to be unpaid work, although if you are willing to take on a good number of additional shots, we can negotiate a stipend.

The deadline for any shots you take on would be April 2.

Please respond with reels (they do not have to be extensive, after all, we know you're just starting out) and any inquiries. Thank you."

"New Country Music Blog Seeks Writers

QR Code Link to This Post
            
        
Dear Nashville Craigslisters: 

I'm a country music journalist launching a new blog in 2020. Currently, I'm working on assembling a small team of regular freelance writers to contribute in the following areas: 

x Song reviews
x Album reviews
x Interviews
x Editorial content
x Open pitches

THE PITCH

Our definition of country music is wide, spanning bluegrass, Americana, mainstream and more. 

My ideal writers are people who fucking love country music, but also have a complicated relationship with it. They're people who are willing to kick the genre's tires and take a look under the hood. 

For this gig, ""fit"" is equally important as writing and reporting talent.

PLEASE APPLY IF

o You're cool being edited (a lot).
o You're willing to collaborate (yes, even as a freelancer).
o You're interested in examining country music critically.

Please do not apply if: 

o You're looking for a transactional gig.
o You don't like being edited.
o You work as a publicist. 
o You ONLY know radio country. 

THE PAY

This is a paid freelancing gig. All articles will have an agreed rate prior to assignment (by piece for reviews and by word for features and editorials), payable upon publication. We also pay a kill fee (for features and editorials only). 

HOW TO APPLY

Please send an email with your resume, your per-word and/or per-review rate, questions, and anything else you think is interesting about yourself based on this weird job posting."

Hello! My name is Dan and my house mates and I are putting together a biweekly nude figure drawing class to be held in the small studio attached to the front of our house.  This will be a sacred and safe space purely for furthering our artistic talents.  We will be allowing alcoholic drinks so long as everyone is moderate and keeps it on the social side.  Ideally this will be an hour to two hour gig, with breaks so the model doesn't get exhausted.  Most of us are in our mid-late twenties and are looking to create an environment that pushes us to grow in our talents and be open and available for constructive criticism.  Down the road I would love to have two models per night and we are open to couples, for now we will most likely be switching it up for every session.
Pay:  Everyone involved (aside from the hosts) will be paying $5 or more to the model for their time and we are aiming to have 7-8 people per night. 
If this sounds like something you would be into please respond with a photo or two of yourself, preferably a full length body shot.   I will do my best to respond to everyone, and if not chosen for this first session there is a good chance you'll be contacted about the next one. We are open to all body types and do not discriminate based on size age, race or gender. This is a professional setting.  We look forward to hearing from you!"

I am a 23 year old artist who is writing and recording my debut dark pop album with rock and hip hop influences. We are preparing to film my second music video and are looking for an actor or model to spend approximately 3-4 hours on set as we film this part of the music video. 

A bit about the gig: The right candidate will play my love interest in this video. There will be some physical interaction between me and the actor/model on set, though nothing sexual. The video will follow my love interest and I as I struggle with substance abuse. 

I am a gay man, and we are looking for a candidate who is also a man and of similar age as me, give or take a few years.  The ideal candidate does NOT have to be queer, but must be comfortable playing the role of my love interest. 

A bit about my team: I’m signed to a small record label out of Los Angeles. My filmmaker is a professional who has filmed on 6 continents. My producer has worked on a handful of records that have charted on Billboard. The team at my label have previously worked with several a-list celebrity artists. 

If you’re interested in this role, please send me an email with your name, age, a few headshots, experience, and your portfolio (or instagram if you don’t have a portfolio). I will be responding to all inquiries rapidly. 

Thank you."

"Looking for women to start an exotic dancers business

QR Code Link to This Post
            
        
I am starting an adult entertainment business and need women who are sexy, smart, funny and capable of working with other women. I need women that are ready to take a chance at what will most likely become a very profitable opportunity. I plan on starting an exotic dancer business with many other ways of generating income, like shooting and recording picture and video to market. Not only will you be able to make money from your shoots, but you will also be creating your own portfolio to use as a resume if you would like to try and further your career in the adult industry. I am located at the very top of the state of Maine and understand that relocating is a must for this to work out. It is small towns where I am but don't let that stop you. It is beautiful country, a safe and peaceful place, full of bored men willing to spend their money on sexy women. It is also a great place to raise children to all of you moms out there that could be using their bodies, sensuality, sexual prowess and knowledge of how to attract men, to make some good money. Moms, I can offer good clean free housing until I get you your own full apartment with everything included. You pay nothing! This is not a lie... I can provide free housing with shared living until I can get you your own apartment at no cost, everything included! If you need a change of scenery and want to become a part of this business I'm starting, you won't be disappointed. You have my guarantee that if you change your mind at any point, I will accommodate you and take full responsibility to get you to wherever you want to go. No contracts, this is a business I am starting and I want it to be in full partnership with all employees. Free to go, free to do as you please. There will be plenty of opportunity to advance in this career that is hard to make a go of and make good money. My plans are pretty simple... Start this adult entertainment business legally, so that the women I have working with me can earn as much as possible, legitimately. I would like to find a woman or women that can help me start this from the ground up, creating a website together and helping me make this venture the best it can be. It will take some time to get everything figured out and situated, but there will be money to be made from day one and I am willing to support you until you can support yourself. The cost of living up here in Northern Maine is very low, for example, rents are anywhere from $300 per month. As the provider of this business, I want to make sure that anyone working with me has everything they need without having to spend their hard earned money. It may sound like a risk to take since I need models before opening the actual business(which won't be hard), but I assure you, I will do whatever it takes to make sure your needs are met and if you want to back out at any time, I will immediately get you where you want to be, even if that's across the country. I will move you here to join me and I will move you back to any part of the country you would like to go. I want this business to be ""employee owned"" although I want it to be a full partnership for all models willing to work with me. This means, all models will be named on the business as full partners and will have complete say over day to day operations, along with the choice to take out loans against the business for whatever you would like. I am a very loving, caring and understanding man. I don't like to get angry in general and will NEVER treat you unfairly. I promise to be the easiest person to be a part of this business    with, as I have the most respect for ALL women and love to do the best I can to please others. None of this is out of despair. It comes from years of knowing that I should be doing this for a living. 
With all of this being said, you should easily see why I haven't started the business before finding the models... I want the first women to join me to help me create the entire business, from the ground up. If needed, I will start this business with just the models as owners and just make myself an employee to you. This is how much faith I have that this is going to be a successful venture, I've already done a lot of math on this. 
So, PLEASE, don't hesitate to contact me about all of this with plenty of questions. I have a couple of good lawyers to make sure I have no choice but to stand by what I offer, if that's needed on your side. If you have the body and the looks, I don't care what your past was! Get in touch with me! Moving to Northern Maine might be what stops many of you, but stop and think... If done right, you can earn plenty of money to perform for a month and go back home for whatever amount of time as you need. You should be able to continue making money while you are away with the many ways of generating money we will be dealing with. I'm open for opinions and hope to get some decent responses. Thank you for your time and consideration."

Hello! We are looking for United States based individuals who do not use their facebook accounts that often and are looking to, essentially, rent the advertising side of their profile.

Facebook has two sides to it. The personal side full of news feeds and cat photos, and then the advertising side that is hidden behind the scenes.

Recent changes to Facebook's algorithm have made it more and more difficult to keep advertising accounts open, even though we only run compliant, vanilla ads.

Because of this we have had to turn to various communities to find volunteers to rent their profiles out to us.

You may have seen the ""make money from your Facebook account"" ads... this is the same thing.

If you are interested, the job entails just sticking with us while we get everything set up behind the scenes, and then that's it. It's a set and forget, you may continue using your Facebook account as before. We operate behind the scenes and even though everything that we do is compliant, legal and ethical, you won't see anything on your side.

We respect you and your privacy. This is the easiest set and forget income/job you can find.

Again, US-based accounts only. Your age or gender does not matter. Depending on Facebook account age we would be willing to compensate you anywhere from $50-500/month sent directly via PayPal.

Thank you!"

Hello!

My company, Grid Media Group, is looking to hire a few 20-30 somethings, both male and female, to pose for a few corporate stock photo-type pictures that we'll be using for a web project. I should note that any models involved in this shoot would not be able to use the photos we take in their portfolios, but it is a paid job.

We are based in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania and the photoshoot would probably take about 2-3 hours. We're thinking a lot of the photos will be in the sort of theme you can see in these mood boards:

"LF: Blazing Fast Contract Video Editors

We are Blaze Streaming - an event industry video production company based in Portland, OR.

We’re looking for experienced, highly-attentive, and fast video editors. 

We edit “Breakouts”, a type of presentation given at conventions and conferences. Each project will have several hundred edits. Each video consists of a picture-in-picture (PIP) graphics overlay, a record of a slide deck synced with audio, and 4k camera footage. The camera footage is placed in the PIP window, and keyframed to keep the presenter in the allotted space. Here’s a short example of what this looks like!: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5cZu4GWoQs&feature=youtu.be

Because of the high volume of our project deliverables, consistency and attention to detail in the edit is absolutely key. 

Among other projects, you’ll be editing videos from the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco.  For this show alone, the editing team as a whole will be delivering roughly 700 videos! This means moving fast and being efficient are must-have qualities for any editor on the Blaze team.

The position includes a paid Training Bootcamp, where you’ll learn the intricacies of our specialized workflow.

This will be an in-office gig (with the opportunity to eventually negotiate remote work). We’re located in the Foster-Powell neighborhood in SE Portland.

Preferred experience:
Keyframing
High volume projects
Adobe Premiere (must)

Here are the details:

Dates: Month of March (Training will start on March 2nd; may not last the whole week)
Rate: $20/hr (with the potential to grow quickly once competence is demonstrated).
Software: Adobe Premiere Pro 2020
Contact: Alex Crowson - Edit Team Lead - (alex[at]blazestreaming[dotcom])
Send us: an intro email including your editing qualifications, 2 examples of your editing work, and something interesting about yourself.

We can’t wait to meet you!"

Hi!

We're looking for someone who can pull images like the ones in this video:

https://vimeo.com/390113572/3e6921d64c

You'll be given a rough cut of the video (with no images on green screen), along with short descriptions of what we'd like to see at each point in the video.

You're just doing the individual still graphics - we'll have someone else work on animation (unless you also do motion graphics, but our plan is to keep them separate).

We'll also give you access to our Shutterstock account, so you can pull vector graphics and images from there.

Here's what matters to us:

1. You are 100% confident that this is *exactly* the sort of thing you can do really well, without too much strain.

2. You are a total expert at Illustrator. (We use the newest version of Illustrator CC. Let us know if you have that version.)

3. You are great with typography. Probably 1/3 to 1/2 of the things you put together will be just type.

4. You have a great eye - and you can send us a link to work of yours that proves that.

5. You work fast. We'll need all the graphics for each individual video done within 24 hours of when you start. (And we're doing 2 videos a week.)

Please reply with a resume and a link to your work.

Include a short message that makes it clear why you're ideal for this.

Pay is $25 per hour, via Venmo, Paypal or check (your choice).

Hi, my company shoots a lot of events that are all 1-4 days, sometimes once a month, sometimes several events a month, many times back to back. It’s usually a mixture of b-roll and interviews. Despite how organized our footage is we have a special method of sifting through every clip and organizing it into timelines in preparation for editing promotional videos or testimonial videos. It usually takes 6-15 hours to complete depending on how many days of footage there is. We need an extra person to help with this. You don't have to be in Scottsdale, any city in the Phoenix Metro area is fine.

Depending on the urgency of the project, we would have you pick up a copy of the hard drive, or mail you a copy of the hard drive, which has all the footage. You’ll be responsible for sifting through the clips, creating all of the timelines and then shipping/delivering the hard drive back to us. We usually need the hard drive back in 3-5 business days.  

All work can be done at your home or office, however, if you are chosen to help I will ask that you meet with me the first time so that I can show you a sample and give you instructions on how I like the clips sifted and timelines created. 

All work is contract work on a 1099 basis. When selected, you must submit a completed W9 and you must have a valid subscription to Adobe Premiere Pro CC 2020. 

Rate of pay will be $25-$40 per hour depending on project urgency, your experience, and reliability. Also, once you get familiar with our editing style there may be opportunities for you to edit promotional or testimonial videos at a higher rate. In fact, I'm also interest in highly skilled editors who can edit promotional type videos like the ones seen on our demo page on our website. If you think you qualify, please send your info and some samples!

Please reply to the Craigslist email with your interest, experience and contact info. We will reply ASAP if we chose to add you to our list of contractors. We look forward to working with you, thank you!

"Online Dating Ghostwriter: Impersonate Me on Dating Apps, Get Me Dates

QR Code Link to This Post
            
        
I don’t have time for online dating. It’s a chore. I also hate doing it. I love going on dates and having voice chat conversations, but I hate constant online texting and writing. I am looking for a writer to take that over for me.

I am looking for someone to login to my online dating sites and apps and do the online chatting for me. I will send you info about my hobbies, interests, and personality. I can also send chat transcripts of previous conversations. This will be for male on male LGBT dates, relationships, friendships, or hookups. These online chats may include the discussion of fetishes and kinks.

You would be working directly with me, a single guy looking to get online dates. When I chat with someone online, I typically like to chat with them for an hour or two with text chatting. I like to respond to their messages immediately in case they happen to be online. If the online chatting goes well after a while, I like to schedule a voice call, which is an easier and faster way to get to know someone and determine chemistry. If the voice call goes well, then I like to schedule an in-person meeting. While you, the writer, will obviously not be involved in the voice call, I would need your help for all online chatting that will take place before and after the voice call.

Pay is negotiable and may be based on the number of hours you spend chatting, or the number of messages you send, the length of those messages, or the quality of their content. A bonus may be given for each time I meet someone new for a date that you’ve chatted with online. Serious inquiries only! 

Since I am picky when selecting romantic partners, this gig is likely to last for many months, or even many years. It really depends on:
•	How affordable our negotiated compensation is to me
•	The time you spend chatting with online matches
•	The quality of your writing, and how well it accurately represents me
•	How well you respect my privacy when chatting with online matches
•	How easy you are to get a hold of for chats about writing feedback and strategic planning
•	If I start dating someone that I want to remain exclusive with, then we’ll pause the ghostwriting, but since I am picky, this is extremely likely to not happen for years

Here is the process I’d like to follow:
•	For each app/site, I may write my profile content for have you write the content
•	I select who I’d like contacted and send the list to you (or I just swipe right)
•	You send ice-breaker message to those candidates
•	Shortly after the candidates respond, you began a back-and-forth conversation, and continue it “live” especially if they are currently online or responding to messages immediately
•	I will give feedback on the conversations (does it sound like me, is it appropriate, etc.)
•	After online chatting with these candidates for a few weeks (or shorter or longer than that based on our subjective assessment for their receptivity), you will schedule a voice call
•	I will do a voice call chat with the candidate. Ideally this chat will last as long as needed to determine if I have chemistry with the candidate, like their personality, and want to meet. If so, I will make plans to meet them in person.
•	After I meet the candidate in person, I will most likely take it from there, but may ask you, the ghostwriter, to continue conversing with them afterwards. If I voice chat with the candidate, and we don’t nail down concrete plans to meet, then I may also ask for you to continue chatting with the candidate.

For each website and app we use for online dating, I will send you login information so that you can chat with everyone that I find interesting. The websites and apps that we’ll use may include, but are not limited to: Recon, Grindr, Tinder, Plenty of Fish, OK Cupid, Hinge, Howlr, and more.

You must use perfect grammar and spelling. If you’re interested, please reply to this ad. After exchanging a few e-mails, you must be available for a phone interview to determine if you are a fit for my needs. I look forward to someone taking over the writing chores out of online dating for me!"

Need a really FAST (need to go live for valentines; FRIDAY) and creative editor who is good at conveying emotional pieces like love stories. Can you make your audience cry by letting them truly feel the emotion of your piece?

Would like to produce a 10 minute short heartbreaking love story that serves as a reminder to all to hold on tight to those they love while they can. Also a message that even if you lose someone you can be happy again. I've already shot most footage and did a 6 minute cut, but the cut does not convey the emotion I want to. I want the viewer to really feel the pain in the story and be moved by it as well as uplifted.

Basically I want to supercharge the emotional power of the short and make sure the message is clear.

Looking for direction on how it should be cut. Music choice and other such elements to get the feeling I want. Would like an editor to recut it. Should be something that will get shared a ton and I'll gladly put your name all over it! Can we go Viral?

See below. This is not actually made as the short I want to make. This is part of the actual story I'm trying to tell. This video was made as an expression of love during the real life story I'm now trying to dramatize. Again, to be clear, the link below is a REAL video which is part of the story I'm now trying to tell. It was made for the love interest, not for theatrical purpose. The theatrical piece is what I want you to do.

"VA based artist in Portland seeks muse

QR Code Link to This Post
            
        
Please read entire post. Pretty please with a cherry on top. 

Artist looking for female model. (sorry fellas, next trip) Little to no experience is preferred. Not open to models who consider themselves aspiring models... I love ya... but just need regular folks this time. 

Curvy, thin...these things are not a factor. just real. 

OVER 25 please. 

TEXT NO EMAILS (It's fun to see who follows directions) photo/name/age please. If ya email, ya better be pretty damn charming. :) 

I'm VA based and on a road trip through Maine in the winter. Yeah, I know. :). When your passion is your job as it is mine, after a while you start to lose the passion and it becomes a job. So once a year I go somewhere I have never been, where I don't know a soul, and intensionally don't do a lot of research on the town the dark landed on. I go and work. work for fun, shoot WTF I want.. and ask people to join me on the ride. I know, sounds weird. It is. So hey Portland. What's up?

So, I approach my work like a jazz artist. No my instrument. Know where to be. know who I am playing with. Start to make noise, the muses will flutter, and the song will reveal itself. So I don't have any ideas. I don't have any concepts. You are the other musician. We will get to those things together.

I MIGHT have a pool to shoot in and do some underwater. MAYBE. I am not sure I want to work that hard.

Why CL? I don't know.. thought maybe I would reach folks that I normally wouldn't via FB or IG or blah blah. Plus IG models grrrr no no no. 

I hope to meet new folks who embrace new experiences and appreciate the work.

YOU WILL NOT BE ASKED TO REMOVE YOUR CLOTHES... No nudes, implied nudes, no underwear, no ""hey, let's try these fishnet stockings"" or creepiness in general. 

Happy to send my website and phone number and all that after we touch base. 

AGAIN - no emails. TEXT photo/name/age please.

"Need 3D Rendering of 2D Drawings (Fee=$1,000.00 to $1,500.00)

QR Code Link to This Post
            
        
All email RESPONSES ""MUST"" be SUBMITTED between TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 11TH AND MONDAY, FEBRUARY 17TH because ""Time Is Of The Essence.""


We would like a 3D rendering of 2D drawings of our house (presently under construction) as drawn by our architect. Final second and third floor plans (with a lap pool in the backyard) are due from the architect this week. 

Please respond in your first email if you would like to have the architect plans for our house on the lake sent to you in order for you to visualize the project and/or create several sample pages of our house for us to better ""see"" the style and quality of your work. The successful candidate will have both our architect's and our landscape architect's plans (for site location and topography) emailed to them. Photos of work done so far are available upon request. Please supply your name, address, cell phone number and your email.


Perfect is not required; however, if you can do perfect for the above fee, then, well....     Poor and fair are not acceptable either (they would be rejected for insufficient quality and that person would not continue working on the project)....she or he must be able to do what is in this posting plus what we discuss in our first meeting. In addition to the above fee for services there will be a $100.00 fee paid per visit to the man or woman who gets this project for each of three planned meetings. This would raise the total fee paid to the 3D person into the range of $1,300.00 to $1,800.00.


We hope the 3D rendering person will be able to complete this project in about 40 person-hours. To give an estimate of rate of pay, think of the fee as follows: If the negotiated fee is $1,600.00 (it could be higher or lower) and the project takes 40 hours then (given this theoretical example) the rate of pay would be $40.00 per hour. 


My wife and I would like to see: (1)  3D of the different rooms with some furniture and fixtures; (2) the lap pool that is outside the rear wall of the garage facing the lake, and, (3) the exterior of the house, which is 8,500 square feet.   There are a lot of rooms and, if possible, can your 3D include a ""virtual walk-through?""Architect's plans have all the measurements, including elevator, 10 foot ceilings and 24 inch trusses. Our concrete floor slab (including the four car garage slab) and all of the concrete foundation walls have been poured and awaiting the framing stage. 


""Time is of the essence"" -- so we would like to hire a woman or man quickly who can do the 3D ASAP +
with sufficient quality to allow us to ""see"" our future house on computer prior to framing (scheduled for later this month or in early March) so that if we decide to make any changes based upon the 3D views then the changes would be on paper and not in ""Brick & Mortar."" 


While we are waiting for the rain to stop delaying the timeline set by our contractor, my wife and I would like to hire a person to do the 3D renderings before framing begins. Whoever answers that they are able and have the time to do the project rather quickly ""must"" provide ""three items"" as part of an ""email response"":  (1) She or he MUST give us DIGITAL SAMPLES of their prior work product;  (2) we will need a fixed price for the 3D renderings (ok to base it upon the square footage...$1.50/ft; $1.75/ft -- plus or minus); and, (3) the 3D renderings must be able to be downloaded to our laptops so that we can view and wander around the 3D of the interior and exterior. 


Price is negotiable within the above range depending on samples provided. The total price for the 3D drawings cannot exceed the above budget maximum. We are searching for a woman or man who has the talent to do the renderings of the house interiors with furniture and fixtures, with the lap pool facing the lake, and, with outside 3D of the external of the house. The successful person wants to get paid for this project plus add our home to their portfolio, i.e., he or she is a person who can do this independently. Upon successful completion of this project we will gladly be a reference to the 3D rendering person for work well done and recommended because of his or her excellent work creating our 3D drawings. 


The person selected should meet with us at three ""planned visit"" times: (1) planning and communication; (2) first draft explained; and, (3) final draft explained. For each of these three meetings the person will be paid separately at the rate of $100.00 per visit in addition to the budgeted amount paid to the selected person. All fees paid C.O.D. with progress payments at mutually agreed upon ""milestones"" of work product submitted to owners and accepted by them as to quality. 


We will work with you online and by phone and by text to assist as much as possible with any questions, issues, etc. that arise while you are working. We wish to be communicating with you while you are working so that the three of us can move the project forward quickly by not allowing some of the 3D to be created and us not approving it, e.g., we don't think something is correct so the three of us talk about it, thereby assuring that the three of us won't have any portion of the 3D renderings ""sent back"" for editing and the budgeted ""time is of the essence"" goal is achieved. This will also make alterations possible while 3D renderings are in your thoughts and not yet put into the computer. 


We are looking for a man or woman who will complete our ""three-person team"" by interacting and communicating (excellent written and verbal communications a ""must"") with us to rapidly, and with few, if any, ""re-do"" requests for the 3D computer renderings. We operate and believe it is ""ok"" to make mistakes....you won't be ""jumped on"" for any first-time errors as long as you learn from it and ""do not"" make the same error more than once, i.e., simply put, ""Please do not make the same mistake twice.)


Thanks to you who ask to be considered. I expect NOT to be able to answer all emails, so please accept my thanks to all of you here as a group rather than in a personal email to each of you thanking you for contacting us for consideration.

Warm Regards, 

-Steve"

I'm a senior software engineer in the Bay Area. I've taught myself design and enjoy taking on product manager responsibilities at work. I'm currently working full-time and I have no time to work on this journaling app that I put my blood sweat and tears into.

I want to hire an Android Product Engineer per-project. First project I have in mind is adding a swipeable menu for each recycler view item. My journaling app's main screen is a recycler view. Each item represents a single entry from the day's entries. 

Here's my app: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.compscieddy.writeaday

My current job has taught me the importance of valuing my time: being very careful which feature I choose to spend my time on. I maximize for impact and so I'm looking for a partner engineer that is also able to ruthlessly prioritize their own time as well. This means making the right trade-off in terms of the ""right"" engineering architecture vs a quicker implementation solution.

I really believe in this vision of building a journaling app that can truly complement our lives. The best app for writing everything about what you've done. It's an amazing feeling to be building something that has people constantly writing in about how the app has helped them.

Text me at 248-622-3842. Briefly tell me where you're coming from, what you're currently up to, and how working on Writeaday with me will help get you where you're headed to."

Hi,

I have a PHP script that has been written but needs one last piece done and I do not have the time to do it.
The script makes a soap call and returns a XML result that is stored in an XML file in the same directory. That XML file needs to be processed into a usable JSON file.

I have 15 years of experience in Programming and someone who knows what they are doing with XML and JSON should be able to do this in under 30 minutes with no problem. I got close but was getting issues in getting the XML to actually go into a JSON string.

If you can get this done in under 30 min for $25 there will be a lot more work ahead for you as we are doing a massive online marketing campaign that will require many more jobs like this and even more complicated ones.

Once again if you have gotten this far put I AM IN THE USA in your subject line.

"Graphic Designer for book Chapter Headings

QR Code Link to This Post
            
        
I'm finishing up a book writing project... The title is ""Living Large 4 Less"".   It's designed to help everyday people get the most out of their hard earned money.    The whole book is going to be printed in full color including every page so the reader can get a full color experience.

What I'm looking for is a creative design header for each of the 13 chapters.    Besides the title... I want a graphical
treatment that is upbeat, progressive, and visual.   The header can occupy up 1/3 of the top of the page.

Layout is 6"" wide... 9"" tall... pretty common book size.   I've included the first 5 chapter titles along with the 
a bit of copy that starts each chapter.    While I was writing the book I grabbed some art off of google images
to give an idea of what the the title covered.   I am having all the illustrations associated with each chapter redone by a gifted illustrator.   

What I'm wanting is a talented Graphic Designer to come up with a treatment that can incorporated with the title.
I kinda like the font I've used already... but if you are a talented Graphic Designer... I'm open to your ideas and concept.      I've got a budget of $100 for each chapter heading banner.   

I'm including the current chapter headers ....   Also I'm including the cover
art for the book so you can get an idea of the initial style for the book.   What ever you come up with needs
to be something that I can ultimately legally use - copyright.   

I'm sure you probably have a website that shows me some of your past work... All well and good, but my main 
interest is what your ideas/ treatment looks like using  my project content.   Pick any title you like and
show me what you can create.   Impress me.. and you get to do all of them.

"Writting job avaible in atlanta

JOB DESCRIPTION
Basically, a writer is someone who writes for a living, creating fiction (e.g. novels, short stories, scripts for films, theatre and television), non-fiction (e.g. biographies, autobiographies, web content and reference books) or poetry. They often work as freelancers.

Some writers are commissioned to write television scripts, whilst others will write articles for magazines and newspapers. Other writers may work as ‘ghostwriters’ (writing on behalf of someone else, under their name). Novelists and writers of non-fiction books tend to spend their time working on one single project, which takes a lot longer to produce.

A writer usually needs to do research, writing, editing, fact-checking, adapting and rewriting. More popular writers may even need to attend book signings or give press interviews for publicity purposes.

SALARY & BENEFITS
There is certainly money to be made as a writer. However, there is quite a disparity between the earnings of the most successful writers and the lesser known writers out there.

Many full-time writers in the UK actually do other jobs to support their writing. Some work in academia and others undertake freelance copywriting and editorial projects for other publications.

Often, the actual income that writers earn from their writing can be less than £10,000 a year.

Of course, those who are more successful will receive better pay. For instance, novelists usually receive no less than £100,000 for the television and film rights of their works (and that doesn’t even include the extra income they will generate from the resulting increase in book sales).

The top screenwriters in the industry can also receive an annual salary of more than £100,000.

WORKING HOURS
Writers might work during holidays and weekends. After all, a writer’s work doesn’t tend to be restricted by conventional working hours. The career path of a freelance writer can lack a certain amount of job security, as success is often dependent on people’s opinions and fluctuating market trends.

The job can sometimes be lonely, since writers don’t work in an office, and rarely work alongside other people. However, a writer’s career will allow you to have a great amount of freedom, as you won’t be shackled to a desk in a sterile office environment.

ENTRY
Many writers have degrees in English, journalism, or creative writing. However, writers from other academic backgrounds are actually very common. In fact, many successful writers don’t even have undergraduate degrees.

A degree may be useful when applying for other jobs, and writing programmes do strengthen one’s writing skills, but the industry is one that honours talent and ability in spite of academic credentials.

Writers can take short writing courses for training purposes. Postgraduate degrees aren’t necessary, but can provide essential training for those focusing on a specific area of writing.

Basically, all you need are excellent writing skills, an individual writing style, excellent time management, stupendous research skills and a talent for networking."

"ISO anyone w/ great English grammar written & oral - f Russian student

QR Code Link to This Post
            
        
Hello, 

I'm trying to help my friend find a native english speaking person (with just a regular Southern California accent) who would be interested in either a language exchange (she'd help you to learn Russian while you help her to learn English), or as a paid tutor. 

The rate if paid is low because she is paying from Russia where the earnings are much lower than here in California (we'd pay via paypal) (average earnings in her town in Russia are about $150 - $400 per month). 

We are thinking about $6/hr. So this is really just for someone who wants to make friends online with a smart Russian adult girl. We'd prefer a female guide so that she can more closely emulate exactly how you pronounce words, etc. Any person from high school age and older with good english grammar in written and spoken communication would be ideal. 

Tutoring would occur using an online platform that's like Skype, but lets you both view a PDF textbook at the same time. All you do is chat in English, and help guide her through a PDF of an english course or text book that we'd find online.

Ideally we'd have 2 lessons a week at 8am, with each lesson lasting about 1.5 hours. 

If you are interested, please just write us a few sentences about yourself. Please also indicate whether you'd like a language exchange, or to be paid. If $6/hr is too low, let us know what would be interesting for you.

Mainly we're just looking for a fun and nice person who is patient and enjoys the English language. We definitely do NOT need anyone with prior experience in tutoring. She just wants to practice talking and writing. 

It's a little like helping your little sister with english homework, except she might be older than you (she's mid 20's)."

"ElasticSearch Wordpress Filtering Help

QR Code Link to This Post
            
        
I am looking for someone who is fluent in ElasticSearch and can help implement search filters on a WordPress website. 

The details: I have a WordPress website with Woocommerce installed on it.  The site has more than 40,000 products, each with variations as well as custom fields.  The site is hosted with Cloudways and I am using their self hosted ElasticSearch installation.  This is powered through Wordpress with the Elasticpress plugin.  Currently elasticsearch works on the site but I can only do searches in the search field.  

Needs: I need someone who can help create search filters/facets to help filter posts in our Woocommerce store based on the values in the custom fields.  Search filters would consist of dropdowns, check boxes, and possible range sliders.  Because of the size of the site it is imperative that this integrates with Elasticsearch.  

Background: I have tried using numerous filtering plugins but all of them fall short.  The challenge is getting them to work with Elasticsearch.  Each plugin wants to build its own index of the search and the site is just too large for that to work which is why I am using Elasticsearch.  Elasticseach is hosted on our cloudways server and we would like to keep it that way for now because of cost restrictions.  

If you are familiar with elasticsearch, Wordpress and search filtering using custom fields then please reach out to me with your hourly rate.  Thank you."

QR Code Link to This Post
            
        
This study will run Tuesday, Feb 25 and Thursday, Feb 27

If you are a back-end or fullstack developer , you are likely a fit for this study.
If you would like to be in a 60 minute one on one interview that asks you questions about the work you do as a developer and your experiences, please let us know. The study pays $200 Visa cash card, or Amazon $200 cash credit, and we send that within 24-48 hours after you complete your interview.

This interview is NOT a test, it's to help a product team understand more about the needs of users. It will be a one on one interview.

To qualify, please respond with this info:
1) Your age. You should be between 18 to 65 years old:
2) What is your employment Status:(FT,PT,Self-employed,Student,Other) :
3) Do you create software applications,build/write computer code, or develop websites or complex macros?
4) What best describes your primary job responsibilities (FT developer,PT Developer, Architect, QA/Test, OpsStudent/Hobbyist or Other)?
5) Please give us your email address and phone number as Craigslist does not give us a way to know these things and we will want to contact you to get you in the study!

The fine print:
• We take your privacy very seriously and will *never* sell your information or share it without your prior written consent. If you ever request to be removed from our contact list, we will do that promptly.
• Please remember that you should be nearly 100% confident that you can attend the session we book you for. Our ability to continue to recruit and schedule participants for studies at various clients is based largely on show-rates. If you need to cancel and are unable to find a qualified replacement, we may not be able to invite you to future studies. We have had far too many people agree to be in studies and then decide they can't make it. This is bad for everyone. Anyone who is a no-show for one of our studies will not be eligible for future studies.
• You should also account for Seattle traffic. It's never good, so please be aware that it'll take you a while to park, check-in etc. The lab has free soda and other beverages, so it'll be totally worth it.
• You will be asked to sign a research participation form (AKA an NDA). Your compensation will be mailed to the address you give us, so be sure you give us the correct info!
• We have had a few people ""fake"" their way into studies recently. If we discover someone intentionally lied their way into a study by misrepresenting their job, or themselves, they will be permanently banned from future participation. Also, as of 2019, we will not pay anyone who is discovered to have lied their way into a study.
• We reserve the right to remove anyone from a study who has not signed their paperwork at least 24 hours before the study.

Hi my name is Jamal and I am a digital ad agency expert and Shopify automation expert. 

I run ads to a Shopify store to help make products sell and turn the store into a $10,000 month + store. 

I can do so within 30-90 days. 

If you aren't familiar with Shopify do a youtube search, it as an commerce platform to sell and drop ship products. 

Digital Ad Agency: We sell Radio and Television Commercials at a fraction of retail cost to business owners and we allow you to become a partner to make 50% profits of our campaigns. We charge 2500-20k for our services so this makes for high payouts. 

The same ads that cost 15k -100k we get in our company for $25-$400, and sell to customers at a higher cost, but still lower then retail. 

We do radio ads, tv ads, and more. 

This helps our clients get into passive income to make 10-20k+ a month. 

If you want in on this program, you must have a good credit score, or decent credit with proof of income, or a job. This will allow you to finance the advertisement needed for this program which is 5-10k.

I have a strategy, but hope that you'll be able to make it even better. 

Simple weekly reports and casual electronic communication a few times a week are expected. May want to briefly meet IRL once a month or so, in Tucson. 

Roughly 5 hours and $80 a week to start, but it's not really an hourly gig. There will be specific and reasonable targets for each week and if you can do it well in less time, that's wonderful. 

I have other projects in the works and the right collaborator will have the bandwidth and the desire to take on more as we grow. 

Each project will have clear roles, expectations and rewards.

work hard...
consider yourself an extremely curious person...
and are coachable...

We are doing marketing for several reputable B2B clients, and need to reach out to thousands of people over social media. Due to limitations from some of these platforms, we are offering a month-to-month referral marketing program in order to increase our outreach efforts. We'll pay you $200 per month. Once your referral account is set up, nothing else is needed from your side other than turning in your referral invoices. We are going to be reaching out to promote different business products such as software and phone systems. All that we'll be doing is asking people to connect, by sending connection requests. When they do connect, we will send them information on the products and see if they would like to move over to email, and eventually have a phone conversation.

This is suitable for someone who is not so active on social media. Basically if you have an account, but don't care about it much, then this will be fine. Also, pay will be upfront every month.

Whenever this ends, you will have a very large number of connections, which can be seen as a nice asset to have.
