Internship Opportunity for the NYSCA funded feature ""Pocahontas Returns"" at the New York studio of the international artist Nadja Verena Marcin (www.nadjamarcin.com) at Kunstraum LLC (kunstraumllc.com).

Looking for a Production Assistant Intern. Must be available to work on the project prep in Jan/Feb 2-3 days per week and be available for 6 shooting days in the second half of February 2020 (mostly weekends).

We are shooting the first ""New York"" part of the film which is set between New York and Bolivia. Become the right hand of Assistant Director and Producers, responsibilities include:

· Various research assignments for props, costumes, locations, cast, crew, production, mood boards, music, others.

The feature film ""Pocahontas Returns"" explores lost values inside our contemporary world and the search for ancient wisdom via the mise-en-abyme of hypermodern New York and neo-baroque Santa Cruz in Bolivia via an interracial love story blended with Telenovela and performance art. Marcin's first feature film ""Pocahontas Returns"" has been awarded funding for the Fiscal Year 2019 by the New York State Council on the Arts. The project is fiscally sponsored by the New York Foundation for the Arts.

Taking its title from the historical, native American chief’s daughter POCAHONTAS, the film uses the title as an abstract theme, shading light on a world that yearns for and celebrates the foreign in a time filled with the renaissance of indigenous cultures, and a new female self-consciousness. As the world quickly adapts to a future of mobility and multi-nationality, ethical and cultural questions need translation, re-evaluation, and freedom to exist. The film is based on an authentic story of two people from different cultures falling in love.

Marcin's work has been presented at Minnesota Street Project SF; Fridman Gallery NY; Microscope Gallery NY; Elizabeth Foundation NY; Abrons Art Center NY; SCHAUWERK Sindelfingen; ZKM - Museum for Art and Media, Karlsruhe; Garage Museum of Contemporary Art, Moscow; Zendai MOMA, Shanghai (Himalajas Art Museum); Museo National de Arte, La Paz; Veneto Videoart Archive, Verona; Museum Ludwig, Cologne; Berkeley Art Museum, Berkeley; ICA Philadelphia; Kunstmuseum, Bonn; 5th Moscow International Biennale for Young Art, Moscow; Haus der Kunst, Munich, and other venues.

Have a script to polish? Want your spiritual (or non-spiritual) story told in Film, TV, or on Stage?

Sign up for this Writing Workshop Series I'm hosting in Los Angeles!

Dates for 2020: Feb 4, 11, 18, 25
7PM – 8PM, Tuesday
Location: Liberate Hollywood
6365 Selma Ave, Los Angeles, CA 90028

To Register, call Liberate Hollywood ASAP at: (323) 745-0495

My name is Lapis Tiger and I'm currently the Executive Producer on a $50MM budget spiritual feature film on Mary Magdalene, and a $2.85MM budget Action Mystery/Thriller TV pilot.

I'm a Writer/Director, Script Consultant, Actress, and Motivational Speaker who has created content that generated interest from some of the top studios and networks in Hollywood! With over 12 years of film production and directing experience, I have worked with the former VP of Marvel, Honda, Ford, Red Bull, IGN, GAMEVIL, Microsoft, and Apple. Previous projects I consulted on include a superhero feature film, an international drama film, and an action series.

My writing workshops will go over:

-tools to critique your own writing, and how to check if the story playing out in your head is the same as what the audience is seeing

-building strong escalations, character developments, and clarifying your characters’ goals and core wounds

-writing from the heart and meditation techniques that help get your mind in the right creative space

-sample great scripts and what makes them stellar

-feedback from the Instructor and students during live reads of your script

-live performances on stage of what you’ve written so you can see what works and what doesn’t (digital footage of the recorded performances will be provided)

Testimonials:

""Lapis Tiger gave incredibly thorough, detailed notes for my short film script, 'Ahma & Alan,' during pre-production (the film will be premiering at the 2020 Seattle Asian American Film Festival). Her insight really helped me hone in on what was essential in each scene and pare away what distracted from the story. She has a deep understanding of emotion, character, and narrative, which she’s able to articulate clearly and succinctly, making her an excellent teacher.""
- James Y. Shih
Writer and Director of “Ahma & Alan”

""When I discovered Lapis Tiger about two years ago, I was struggling with a screenplay for what was essentially 'the origin story' of my connected superhero universe. After speaking via phone, we met up, and Lapis was full of questions about all the characters. When she agreed to come onboard, she was armed with so many layered and textured individuals to weave my grand epic around. I have learned a lot from her, which is why we continue to work together. Currently, we are working on a comic book project as well as the script for a new webseries, but in the back of my head, I have this ulterior motive of Lapis one day in the near future directing a film for me because she now has such a firm understanding of my vision.""
-Sergio W. Willis
Writer and Creator of the not quite superheroic webseries, ""Sasquatch and The Mythology Sisterhood,"" and Creator of the kaiju-flavored comic book, ""Gerbilla""

OPEN to all Spiritual and Non-Spiritual Writers!

Storyboard Artist for animation,"QR Code Link to This Post
            
        
Award-winning Bay Area filmmaker seeks storyboard artists. Selected artist(s) will draw storyboards for dramatic animated scenes that will be part of a documentary film covering specific events of the World War II era. 

Storyboards will first be used by the filmmaker to create ""animatics"" (edited video clips where the storyboards are roughly animated with camera moves, etc). The storyboard artist will then revise and finalize the storyboards as needed before the artwork is handed off to an animator.

First draft storyboards can be loose and rough to sort out composition issues. Final storyboards should be more refined, and must be provided as hi-res (4k or larger) Photoshop files, with backgrounds and characters on separate layers so they can be loosely animated to create the animatic.

The images included in this ad show samples of other storyboards we are using, as well as some sample style frames to give an indication of the range of animation styles to be included in the film.

Requirements:
- talent for realistic and evocative drawing/illustration, especially for use as storyboards in motion picture work
- understanding of motion picture camera angles, moves, and terminology, and appropriate use of all of these elements
- ability to use and incorporate reference materials, such as photographs, archival film footage, and clips already created by other animators working on the project
- ability to create characters and express emotion through all aspects of their depiction, including facial expression, body language, composition/camera angle, etc.
- reliability, work ethic, and ability to take direction and apply constructive feedback

While we are located in the East Bay and we may meet occasionally in person, you will primarily work from your own location.

Quick 30 second video needed of Watertown City Auditorium,"QR Code Link to This Post
            
        
Hi,

Because I live too far away from Watertown, I am looking for someone to shoot 30 seconds of 4k video of the exterior of the Watertown City Auditorium. 

This is for a dissertation project, not for commercial use. You don't need a fancy camera -- the last couple of generations of iPhones shoot excellent quality 4k video.  (It must be 4k.) I just need a straight, steady, shot of the entire front of the building. If you can shoot the interiors as well, one nice shot of the stage too would be great. 

I would like to preview the footage (you choose how) before I pay, but then will pay immediately upon receipt of the final footage. 

Thanks!",compensation: $30,1771cca7431a36f9a893409ca8832150@gigs.craigslist.org,-1,hourly,https://nesd.craigslist.org/crg/d/watertown-quick-30-second-video-needed/7062249386.html
Need VFX Artist--Rotoscoping and Screen Replacement,"QR Code Link to This Post
            
        
I hope you're doing well.

I am moving into the finishing phase of my short film. There's about 30 shots that need VFX work. Unfortunately, we could not shoot green screen on location. So, I am looking for a talented VFX artist who can rotoscope, track, do screen and background (in this case windows) replacement.

My team and I are looking to have the VFX completed for this project by March 1, 2020. 

I would also like the project files deliver, because the replaced background images are still undecided. This way I can make the decision on the final replaced image in my own time. However, it would be awesome to get started on the rotoscoping, tracking, and screen replacement. I have access to Mocha and AE. The shots very in length, the shortest shots are around 4 seconds while there are a few longer shots that are roughly 10 seconds long. 


There's three main objectives: 

1) Windows panels replaced 
2) Rotoscoping a character who is in front of a TV or window.
3) TV screen replacement 

If you're interested please send over an e-mail  with your examples of your work and I'd be happy to show you some examples of that needs to what needs to be completed.

Seeking Artist Assistant for Project,"QR Code Link to This Post
            
        
I have an idea for a project that will require both research and creating artworks.  This is not a full time job and its ideal for a student or someone who otherwise has a flexible schedule and access to a computer.  Once we talk and you sign an NDA I will disclose more about the project, although all rights and credit will go to the artist (me).  The art form is still up in the air, but I'm thinking right now painting and sculpture, but I am open to a collaboration.  I am happy to pay for supplies, studio space if needed, and even a stipend, all depending on the scope of the project.  If interested please respond with your portfolio or social media profile so I get a sense of your work and your energy and we can take it from there.  Warning this is a bit of a dark project so would probably be best for someone who is in line with that.",compensation: TBD,cc8a102b6bb937ffa1b20ce035ee26c2@gigs.craigslist.org,400,day,https://newyork.craigslist.org/mnh/crg/d/new-york-seeking-artist-assistant-for/7062506322.html
