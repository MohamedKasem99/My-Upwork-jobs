Transcription of PDF articles and letters,"QR Code Link to This Post
            
        
I am in need for transcription of about 100 articles from PDF publications.  The publications are from the years 1910s - 1930s, and the articles cover reports of evangelical missionary work in China. The articles vary in size, from a few hundred to a few thousands words.

The services would require transcribing the PDF news article content into MS Word format, putting all articles into a single Word document.

Must keep news articles in chronological order, beginning with the earliest. 

Includes writing publication citation in MLA format for new article. 

Accuracy and quality is important.

Copy and paste is unlikely to be a viable path for getting the content into MS Word.

The turnaround time is not urgent and can be mutually agreed upon. 

The news publications are in PDF format and will be provided in a ZIP file. As best as possible, the relevant sections to transcribe are highlighted. See attached images for examples. Note that the highlighting starts and stops. The highlights are directional, pointing to the article to be transcribed. The expectation is that the whole article is transcribed, and the highlights are just to help recognize the relevant article. 

Since the articles vary in size, it is not clear what the total word count / line count / etc. to be expected or the duration of the work.

Please reply back with relevant experience, WPM typing speed. References may be requested. 

Thank you,

Hey there.

Looking to do a tfp shoot with a female model sporting a pair of vintage style Levi's. 

Depending on the vibe we decide on, we could go to a park for a more Bohemian thing, or maybe in the city for a more Urban feel.

But we can go over details of that later. 

Tons of modeling experience would be great, but not required. As long as you are serious about wanting to shoot. 
This will be a fun shoot we can both add to our ports.

The Chicago paid gig is to digitally (computer) record several Chicago TV channels.  I know how to do this, but I need someone near Chicago.  Specifically, your distance from downtown Chicago is bounded as such:

1. If you're within the broadcast area of at least the 4 national, commercial affiliates (ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox), that would be great.  That almost certainly works within 30 miles, probably 40 miles, maybe 60 miles, and hypothetically 100 miles, but 100 miles is probably way too far.  The more channels and the closer and the stronger signal, the better.  If you're on the borderland, we can look at the FCC maps, and you may know what you can get, and we can otherwise discuss.

2. If you're outside broadcast but in the Chicago cable TV zone, you'd have to have a clear QAM cable signal.  My research so far is that those are becoming rare.  We can discuss / research if need be.

3.a. We have people near downtown Chicago but without the tech knowledge (see below).  If 
you can go to Chicago to set up and then when something breaks, that might work.  

3.b. Similarly, if you have someplace you can host a recording computer within the broadcast zone, that might work, as long as you can get to the computer as needed.

OTHER MUST HAVES

The basic requirements involve very few hours a week or month.  There is more possible work involved, though, which I list below.  

The gig is ongoing in that we hope to record ""forever.""

The computer needs to record at least 17 - 19 hours a day, and it probably makes sense to just leave it on 24/7.  It needs to be connected to an antenna, although not necessarily a big one.  Thus, moving the computer is risky.  You could start off with a laptop but you probably couldn't use it as a mobile laptop.

You'll have to swap out hard drives perhaps as often as every 10 days.

You'll probably have to mail USB drives and / or Blu-rays and / or entire hard drives every few days.  If you're close enough to downtown Chicago to hand-deliver them, great.  (This is one of several factors that I haven't mapped out completely.  My best estimate is the upload speeds to avoid snail mail would be hard to get.  We can discuss if need be.)

As I mentioned, we already know people in the broadcast area.  My concern is that they would be useless as soon as something breaks.  So you need to be technical enough to troubleshoot with my remote help.  

Similarly, eventually I'll probably need to get into the computer remotely.  If that waits until you're using a ""company"" computer, that's fine.  Thus, you may need to open up firewall ports: port forwarding or pinholing.  (Or we might be able to use UPnP.  My research hasn't gotten that far.)  That's also the sort of thing that folks we know can't do.

See my note about communicating in writing below.

REALLY NICE TO HAVE

If you have a computer we can use / rent from you to start out with, that would be great.  Eventually we'll probably send you or pay for you to build a ""company"" computer.

On that point, if you can pick out a used computer for us to pay for and / or get paid to build one, that would save me the trouble of doing so and sending you one.

Running Linux would make my life easier.  Linux within Virtualbox or such may work.  I run Ubuntu, but the distro probably doesn't matter.


EXTRA WORK

If you want to do some basic video editing on an ongoing basis (for pay, of course), that would be great.  I hadn't done it until this project, so I can tell you for a fact that it doesn't have to be pro grade, and I can (hopefully) teach you based on what I did.  It took me 2 - 3 hours to learn well enough including eliminating 2 pieces of editing software.  Now I know what works.

There is another line of work, or at least one, you could do within this, but I don't want to give away all the secrets in a public ad.  Remind me to discuss.


PAY

Pay is negotiable.  I wish I could be more specific, but we haven't done this before, there are a lot of if-then-elses, and I can't quite envision the exact workflow.  We can go through in detail what is needed and then you have a basis to tell us what you want.  I've ""done this"" enough to prove it's doable, but not on an ongoing basis, so, again, there are aspects I haven't mapped out.


""I"" versus ""we""

I hate it when people nebulously use ""we.""  I am the tech guy of this project.  There is also a money lady.  The money lady is a Georgia Tech civil engineering grad, so no tech slouch.  So that's why I switch between I and we.  Also, I hope some of you will be thrilled that it's the tech guy posting the ad and filtering the responses.
  

ONE MORE MUST - WRITTEN COMMUNICATION

I'll add one more must-have qualification, with the approval of the money lady.  You must be comfortable communicating in writing.  I'm the typical to somewhat extreme geek type who is not in a hurry to talk to strangers on the phone.  Also, I am older than the culture of instant communication.  I'd rather substance over speed.  You don't have to answer me immediately on your phone.  In fact, it's probably best never to write me on your phone--at least not until we know each other--it tends to annoy me.  If you don't own a real keyboard--at least a laptop--that almost certainly eliminates you just on communication grounds.

Also, I've suffered a number of times in life because I got on the phone too quickly.  I can tell a lot about someone from a few emails. I make judgement mistakes about someone on the phone that I probably wouldn't by email.


SOFTWARE APPRENTICES

Those of you who look at CraigsList (inter)nationally may have seen my ~15 - 20 software apprentices ads in Atlanta computer gigs, going back to 2013 or so.  I'm still in Atlanta, but I don't care where my apprentices are.  The apprentice gig would be unpaid.  The payment would be learning marketable skills.  Beyond that, that's not the focus of this ad, so ask for more if you want.  I figure anyone who has read this far may pass my written com test.",compensation: negotiable,-1,NA,2d063c2f1158329eba7db21c42f6b76d@gigs.craigslist.org
Webpage designer for art website,"QR Code Link to This Post
            
        
I am looking for a webpage designer to create a website for showing and selling art work of highly sensitive artists, including those with Asperger’s. Connecting with others in person, finding their way into the art market seems daunting to them. A platform to share their beautiful art creations with the world lights my heart up. 

You must be able to create pages with thumbnails of art works that link to a full view, videos of the art works, etc., and a paypal button to accept secure payments, a button for memberships… Something in the line of Artrepreneur.

Must be willing to trade for my services (massage, Feng Shui consultations, Qigong and other classes). I live in the Andersonville area of Chicago.

Looking forward to collaborating with you:)

Freelance Audio/Sound Engineer,"QR Code Link to This Post
            
        
We are a boutique Brooklyn digital recording studio interviewing for a Seasoned/Experienced/Freelance Audio Engineer team member. This is a great opportunity for an audio engineer with an existing client network who is looking for a studio to call home.

Engineer must possess strong mixing, mastering and tracking skills with the ability to jump right into running sessions and work independently with clients. Although the studio will book clients, this is not for the engineer looking only to have bookings given to them. We'd prefer an engineer who has built some clientele and a repertoire, who knows how to bring in work as well. Engineer should be a self-starter and be comfortable with running music sessions confidently and be comfortable with different genres and social scenes. We currently book a majority of Hip-Hop and R&B so this should be engineer’s strong suit; but engineer should also be versatile with other genres. As well, we service film pre/post editing and voice-overs, so related skill sets are a plus.

As part of job responsibility, Engineer must arrive 15 minutes prior to session start time to set up studio and, if needed occasionally, must stay after sessions 15 minutes to close out session. This prep and breakdown time is unpaid time.

To apply:
-	Send resume
-	Send links of your work (engineered songs, projects, film work, etc.)

JOB REQUIREMENTS:

Technical Skills Required

-	Must have thorough understanding of signal flow, microphone functionality placement and pre amp paths.
-	Must be familiar with using various plug-ins such as UAD, MCDSP, SOFTTUBE, SLATE, WAVES, Antares, Izotope, etc. and maximizing their value.
-	Must have knowledge of keyboard and MIDI controller usage and signal flow interactions; frequency range, EQ. compression, limiting, gating, sidechaining, shaping, etc.
-	Must have clear understanding of using a digital console mixer
-	Must have knowledge of new digital audio technologies and editing techniques as well as the music genres’ cultures

Professional/Soft Skills Required
-	Professional studio employment or freelance work in professional studios or viable years of self music employment
-	Must be reliable
-	Must be a self-starter, take initiative and possess strong work ethics
-	Must be able to multi-task, work independently and run successful sessions confidently
-	Must be organized, timely, detail-oriented and personable with good customer service attitude
-	Must have ability to communicate well with diverse groups of people

Extra Plus
-	Humble
-	Music Production knowledge
-	Avid certification
-	ADR / Voiceover and film editing skills
-	Sound Design, Restoration & Scoring skills
-	Audio engineering degree or schooling is a plus but not required
-	Knowledge and usage of UAD Apollo, Pro Logic, Ableton Live, Final Cut Pro, Premier, Slate VMS-1 Mic System, Mic Placement, Maschine Studio, Yamaha keyboards.

This position is in Bedford Stuyvesant in Brooklyn, NY. We would prefer someone close in the area (Bed-Stuy, Crown Heights, Bushwick) or someone who would have no problem commuting quickly to occasionally work last minute bookings. We have a very relaxed laid-back environment and are looking for the same in a prospective engineer team member. This is a Freelance position so we’re flexible to work with your schedule, and expect your schedule should be flexible as well. 

Please only apply if you have serious interest and feel you have the skills to fit the position and can add value.

I am looking to develop a team of writers for short films, series work and one or two location feature films to be filmed at our North Hollywood studio. All shorts will be submitted to film festivals and series episodes will be released on YouTube or Amazon and possibly others.  Looking for great writers in all genres.  Looking for writers who care more about putting out great work and getting IMDb credit and exposure for their films in festivals etc.  Must be easy to work with and open to suggestions of topics, characters etc.  Looking for your original ideas (for our sets) and a collaborative effort.  I am an actor, writer and film producer and looking to develop long term relationships with a good team of writers to help me release more content quicker.  I make high production value films.  I am producing the films and covering all expenses of production.  These are non-union projects and all writing is on a deferred basis.  Nothing is paid up front and will only be paid when the films return a profit. That will most likely only occur with the features. The shorts will be released in film festivals and gain exposure and awards (hopefully) for the writers.  Must be easy going and more about the journey and having fun during the process.

Website and Social Media Marketing,"QR Code Link to This Post
            
        
I sell brand name electronics on Amazon.  I also wholesale to smaller sellers, and to some eBay sellers.  Brand name means, Apple products, Microsoft tables, games, Ultimate Ears speakers, JBL products, GoPro cameras, and much more.

I now want to sell these products on my own website and / or link to other sites that sell similar products.  In other words, I like to build a base of customers around my site, rather than passing them to Amazon.  I understand this takes time.   I have spent substantial amount of time, and money on people that have claimed they know what they are doing, and did not deliver.

The ideal candidate for this job will have enough understanding of the marketing space (using social media, right key terms, working with YouTube / IG influencers, interlinking with other sites, working on landing pages etc), that can tell me roughly what will take place at what time.  In other words, in 2 months, we should be seeing this, in 5 months we should be seeing this etc.

My ideal type of compensation would be to give percentage of growth (sales, profits, increase in numbers etc), and not hourly wage.  I have no problem paying for what makes sense, but I have come to realize that hourly workers are not really interested in the outcome of the project, and just want to get paid today.  That does not work for me, and honestly, that would not work for any business owner.  If you show results, you will make a lot of money, because I have access to a very large selection of great products, all from within U.S., and all new products that are one generation older than current products in stores.

The possibilities of growth here are basically infinite, and really just has to do with one's own vision and dreams.

This project would probably require an hour or two a day work on a consistent basis for the first few months.  I am open to work out a payment structure that would keep the person going, but I am not inclined to do hourly pay for too long, as I do not want to encourage checked out mentality.

I have a nice office in downtown San Diego on 5th Avenue.  You could work from there, or from any other location, but we would need to meet once a week in person to review progress.

Hi,

Looking for autocad drafts person in central florida, preferably close to Sanford, Fl.

I am renting an old warehouse and the owner doesn't have any drawings.  I want to do a build out of a couple offices and would like to see what they look like at first in 2D AutoCad basic drawings so then I can go meet with the building inspector to discuss permits and what will be required for future drawings etc.

I'm looking to hire someone to help me to the initial drawings.  You don't have to be an engineer but do have to know how to use AutoCad to do the initial basic drawings.  

In the future i will have to hire an engineer to do the formal drawings for permits, but for now i just need to get started.

Thanks,
James
