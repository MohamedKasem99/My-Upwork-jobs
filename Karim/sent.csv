Hi, I'm looking to build a small crew of creative and technical professionals in the field of small video production.

I'm a one-man band myself (most of the time). I'm primarily looking for those with  at least one year of experience as a videographer and cinematographer and someone who is truly interested in gaining experience and improving their knowledge base. Don't worry, I don't ask people to work for free. However, I also can't pay *too* much ($15-$20/hr, depending on experience/knowledge). So I'm probably targeting individuals with maybe 1-2 years of related work experience and interest. Looking for people I can work with maybe 3-4 times a month for generally small production jobs. 

The good thing is, I shouldn't ever really need your gear as I generally have enough equipment for most jobs.

I'm just looking for 2-3 people who:

- Have experience with DSLR cameras (and Blackmagic)
- Have a SOLID understanding of the exposure triangle and the important of white balancing.
- Have decent sense of framing.
- Understands importance smooth tripod movement and stillness. 
- Has edited their own work (you learn most of your shooting mistakes when having to deal with your footage)
- Can think on their toes and make adjustments as necessary.
- Have an understanding and some experience with audio field recorders, lav mics, boom mics and basic technique with all of this equipment.
- Basic understanding and experience of 3-point lighting and working with light stands, sandbags, softboxes, reflectors and diffusers.
- Positive attitude! This a tough one because negative people don't always know they're negative.
- Knows how to remain calm under stress.
- Leaves their ego at the door. If you have a chip on your shoulder or feel life owes you more than it's given you, I'm very much not interested in you.
- Tries to keep busy themselves with other work and is constantly learning to become better at what they do.
- Must live in L.A. (in the valley is a plus)
- Has reliable mode of transportation.
- Photography experience is a plus.
- Light Meter experience is a plus.
- Experience with Adobe Premiere Pro is a plus.
- Experience with Adobe After Effects is a plus.

I'm really just looking for people who are easy to work with, have an innate interest in this kind of work and have some foundation of knowledge. Everything else, I can teach. I'm sure there's a few things you could teach me too.

Please feel free to respond by telling me about yourself, your background, and any work you might have to show."

I’m a licensed barbering professional seeking a prompt and reliable model that is available in Chicago February 10th for a hair showcase that doesn’t mind a total hair makeover and is okay with having makeup applied to and worn on you. Ideally someone with open availability on Mondays. 

This isn’t a big production or runway show by any means, but it is kind of the equivalent of the graduation for my salon apprenticeship. You won’t strut or have to runway walk (but you’re welcome to for the ‘gram after the presentation is over). You’ll be either seated or standing still next to me as I live cut or explain my pre cut hairstyle on you to an audience of my co-workers.

MODEL SPECIFICS:

Bowl Cut: Will need to be precut between Feb. 4th and 9th. Model will also need to be present 2/10 from 8:30-9:30 for presentation. Fine/thin or medium hair density with a straight texture for a geometric bowl shape. Must have a full head of hair that reaches jaw or chin level with no undercuts or outgrown fading but okay with going very short. Must be ok with wearing makeup. No gender preferences. No size preferences. MUST HAVE THE RIGHT HAIR. Non-negotiable.

INTERESTED? FOLLOW THESE INSTRUCTIONS:

If interested, reply with little bit about yourself and an image of you in your favorite outfit to help me figure out what to style you in for the presentation. Any clothing or accessories I may have to get for models will be yours to keep as a thank you. Please be sure you’re available the full time 8:30-9:30AM 2/10 for the presentation.

"HAIR MODELS NEEDED - ORIBE HYBRID CUT MODEL - WEDNESDAY 2/5/20

QR Code Link to This Post
            
        
Hi there--

GMLV Casting (formerly Gilleon Smith + Extra Mile Casting www.gmlvcasting.com) here, and we are working with Oribe (https://www.oribe.com/) on an upcoming hair cut demonstration. Models will be used to demonstrate the new ""Hybrid"" cut.

See Specs Below:

The “hybrid” is a freeform approach of working with hands and razor to create movement and reduce bulk. The “hybrid” cut is a mix of two popular Oribe cuts; the graduated bob and the signature short. The length will vary, however this cut will range from a shorter “graduation cut” hair style which is a little edgier and has a little more layers and volume than a classic bob to being short on the back and sides of the head and slightly longer on the top. Models MUST be willing to have their hair cut, and be flexible with what length the hair will be. The overall length of the cut is also flexible based on the hair type, texture, and the preference of the model, but usually ends up chin length or shorter exposing the nape of the neck, with a little more hair on the top and sides. Models should have short to medium length hair.

Hybrid Model Cut Requirements:
Must be okay with the hybrid haircut
Short to Medium Length preferred - *Bobs (any length) or Longer
Fine to Medium Density
Curl Type 1A-3B
Wavy, curly, not too coarse but open to some texture
Existing Bangs Okay
Existing Bob Okay
No Existing Pixie Cuts
No Extensions
No Microbangs
No Undercuts
*Bangs are optional but not mandatory*


Please follow the below instructions to be considered:

**Verify that you can be fully available for WEDNESDAY, 02/5/20
**Please Also Verify (even if you have provided this info for us in the past):
-Full Legal Name:
-Date of Birth/Age Range:
-Current Height:
-Current Weight:
-Phone Number:
-Email Address:
-Union Status:
***PLEASE READ CAREFULLY- IN ORDER TO BE CONSIDERED
You MUST send CURRENT photos of the front + back of your current hair style as well as a photo of your side profile. You MUST send the required photos to be considered for the event.
-Please send a couple of CURRENT / candid digital / selfies of yourself is possible. Please also send any artistic/modeling/headshot.

As soon as we get that information, we will review and get back to you with further instructions.

We look forward to hearing from you, it’s going to be a fun day!

I need a LOCAL, Mpls/St.Paul Twin Cities, Wordpress/hosting/front-end dev expert, to modify code for a redesign of my website. I need someone local who knows WordPress and front end development VERY well. HTML5/CSS3/JS

This is what I'd like to accomplish, if you think you're up to it (the last two devs I worked with failed):

• I have my own domain and website which I have been maintaining myself for 10+ years (I'm a UX Designer).

• It's a small site, with just 4 static pages. One of the pages (just ONE), I would like to be a blog driven by WordPress. The other 3 pages are static html that I will edit, maintain, ftp, etc on my own. 

• I gave previous developers access to my web-hosting account to see if WordPress in a directory (e.g. ""blog.html or /blog/blog.html"" could be hooked up to achieve this. Is this impossible? I use Bluehost as my hosting provider. If changing providers (ugh) is a solution, I'm open to that option. 

• There is some extra code (SASS, LESS, SCSS) which isn't necessary for such a simple site and I would like it extracted. And some small misc user interface (CSS) tweaks that need implementing.

• I have a detailed proposal document that outlines exactly what I'm looking for which I can provide.

• LOCALS ONLY -  I need to meet at a coffee shop wherever in the Twin Cities area to discuss and look at the code in person. If you aren't able to MEET IN PERSON, please ignore this message."

"Are you a helpful business savvy assistant with 10 hours a week ?

QR Code Link to This Post
            
        
Hello there!

I have a new role as a Business Broker and I need your help with quite a few things. You are great at details, systems, common sense and are looking to master a role where you will be effective and appreciated.  My long-term goal is to build a socially conscious business brokerage supporting Entrepreneurs locally through selling their business and globally through providing micro-finance to people who don't have access to capital otherwise. 

It's a humble beginning, I myself am working an additional job until my new role becomes profitable. Right now, it’s expensive hobby but I am getting a lot of client interest so there is great potential. To get there I need someone much more detail oriented to organize my efforts. I'm the typical Entrepreneur, idea person, etc.

Are you a match? Here is a breakdown of what you are great at and don’t worry I do train as well:

Client Relations/Project Manager: Keeping in touch with sellers and buyers as to the status of their transaction (also to other service professionals such as the clients Lawyer, Accountant and more) 1-2 times a week until the deal closes. You will also be requesting information such as tax returns from different parties ( and sometimes 4-5 times until they send it, keeping track of who needs what). 

Working with others: Once trained you will manage a team of two full time remote workers for me and work with 3 appointment setters at my company from time to time. This project management consists of less than one hour a week as most of their work is on their own. You are mostly just making sure that they have everything that they need and are scheduling correctly.

Systems: Take what you know, what you learn from me and organize my operations and marketing manuals. You are great at incorporating those items as we go into action steps. Think of this like a Franchise manual on Google docs.

Basic Administrative: Help me order business cards, manage third party vendors like Google, Calendly, etc. Manage my schedule helping me think of “next steps ahead” as I can get distracted on the short-term things.

Research: Effective business research and reports when I first meet with the business owner and then organizing a presentation to sell the company once they list to sell. This includes recasting financials which requires 100% accuracy in numbers and working with the owners to organize their paperwork

A personal touch: I would like for you to hand address sales letters.

Your Schedule: Starting out with about 10 hours a week with potential with more hours if we both shall like. Looking for someone to mostly work independently from a place of your choosing but local enough to meet in person.

Can you help? If yes, why work with me? 

My goal is to enjoy the process of working together long-term. I am flexible and treat people well. I’m a start-up of a start-up so the initial hourly pay won’t be the highest but if you stick with me it will work out for you. I'm thinking $14-$20 an hour cash depending on your skills and generosity. Make me an offer. Your work has the power to help Entrepreneurs sell their business, many of which have major health challenges and really need our help. That in turn will support other Entrepreneurs globally who have no access to capital. 

To show that you read the ad and are good at details, reply with:
1) What prompted you to respond and why are you a good potential match to work together?
2) What do you know about Tim Ferris and what my goals are related to the way he thinks?
3) How is your handwriting?
4) What are your short- and long-term career goals and how does this role play into it?
5) Resume or Linkedin is optional

Happy 2020!!"

"Brett Vogel - Singer/Songwriter - Help on Spotify & Instagram

QR Code Link to This Post
            
        
Good Day! :-)

Payments are made via PayPal or Venmo - This gig is ongoing! :-) I'm looking for as many people as possible that are willing to help out. :-) 

My name is Brett Vogel and I'm a singer/songwriter and I hope this message finds you doing well! I'm looking for help with promotion on Instagram to drive traffic to my Spotify page. My newest single ""I'm a Buffalo"" is about my personal struggle with addiction, but also about HOPE! Can you help spread the word by sharing ""I'm a Buffalo"" on your Instagram stories? I know there are many people out there just like me that struggle with addiction and depression. I believe the song can help people feel as if they're not alone. :-) It's already helped many others. Music helps people heal. :-) Music is also the universal language. I'm grateful for you and your time. Please help me out if you can. 

Job requires you to share the song on your Instagram stories via the Spotify APP. It's a simple two clicks and literally will take less than 20 seconds. I'm asking for 3 shares a week for 3 weeks so this comes out to $20.00 for a couple minutes of your time. 9 shares total. :-) I also have 30 other songs, so you may share other songs you like as well instead of sharing ""I'm a Buffalo"" each time. I'm really looking for new friends, and like minded people to connect with. If this song and message resonates with you, I'd be grateful to connect and meet you! :-) PLEASE LISTEN TO THE SONGS BEFORE RESPONDING. Will the songs resonate with your friends? Do you resonate with the message? Also, maybe you are an artist yourself and don't care about the money and just want to help a fellow artist. We're all human and all need help sometimes. :-) 

Listen to ""I'm a Buffalo"" on Spotify - https://open.spotify.com/album/5A5teeEkiy25sRbGbrGIVv?si=THcnyymOQp2A2nwWc_hLig

Instagram - http://www.instagram.com/brettvogelmusic Instagram handle is @brettvogelmusic - Follow me here to connect. 

Payments are made via PayPal or Venmo - This gig is ongoing! :-) I'm looking for as many people as possible that are willing to help out, however, I only prefer to work with people that connect with the music/message and aren't sharing just for the money. :-) I will assess your Instagram profile to see if you are a good fit for the job. In other words, if you have 10 followers and have only made 2 posts to your instagram profile you probably aren't a great fit. If your followers primarily listen to rap or hip-hop or heavy metal you may or may not be a good fit. My fans enjoy similar artists like: Hozier, Coldplay, James Bay, Dave Matthews Band, David Gray, Van Morrison, Ed Sheeran, Jeff Buckley, Bruce Springsteen, Ben Howard, Bon Iver, and many others..."

I am a tv show creator/writer/producer. 

I have written a scripted historical drama tv series inspired by true events set in New York City, Lower East Side.

The series uses as a scaffolding/structure a number of true/legitimate historical events, including among them never-fore-unmasked issues/connections regarding President Theodore Roosevelt, his administration AND the impact of certain key/inciting incidents by the show's co-female protagonists that played a major, and never before credited connection to his administration and a lasting impact by these events on the country still felt in contemporary American society. 

There are other key events of this ""never before told story"" that are easily ""google-able"" AND which have a high web presence and huge viral visibility. 

In addition to the actual episodes I have written for the show/series, I have also created an academic/thesis style paper that reflects these never-before revealed historical incidents. My paper is 44 pages long. Another 20 pages includes addenda regarding the actual tv series that sets the complete stage for the academic/historical incidents that are braided into the dramatic story. 

HERE IS THE JOB/TASK REQUIREMENT

I am seeking a Wikipedia Pro/Writing Expert conversant in the described arenas/genres described above (and below)...

AND....

Using/taking my ""academic/thesis"" paper, along with other ""factual data"" using this info and then cross-referencing/citing MY academic/factual discoveries and integrating/adding the elements of my paper/tv show (for which there is an extensive and fabulous (presently unpublished website, we are not ready to go public with) AND have YOU integrate OUR facts/history, etc. into the webisphere adding OUR show info (facts/history based) ON and INTO other Wikipedia Sites that specialize in these historical niches that the show addresses, that will then drive traffic to, and link back to our show website and all other social media. 

If you have proven expertise in Wikipedia, consider yourself a historical-enthusiast, OR, even better, are an academic/scholar with expertise in early 20th century history (story is set in NYC 1900), sub-niche exposure to President Theodore Roosevelt, Feminism, Feminist Movements, Jewish Feminism/ists, Early Jewish History, Early New York City/Lower East Side history, AND CAN WRITE.... then perhaps you might find this gig interesting. 

Please respond with appropriate info - including of course, resume/cv that demonstrates all the above required abilities. Links, writing proof/samples, etc essential.   

This is a once-in-a-lifetime gig, we are looking for a one-in-a-million candidate/person that can and will immerse themselves in both the excitement and gravitas of this incredible opportunity.  We are posting this in NY, LA, Boston, Chicago and Miami; the creator/writer lives in South Florida."

We are doing our first promo ""We"" I. E. One Dude, and Several Attractive Girls) (one girl one dude next week)  at one of the Springs around the Orlando Area.  I have Go-Pros, but it would be nice to add another camera angle, and or some drone footage to the shoots.  This tour is multifaceted, primarily focusing on the plugging of  several outdoor products, including my invention which is a mobile camping shower., as well as a sweet line of sunglasses, and a disc golf company and a kayak-tubing company so far. (E Bike-E Scooter and Water Scooter Partners pending) 

We are going to layer the promo videos with general camping-van life as well as festival life. Ideally we would like to procure a partner with the skills (on the editing or the photo-video side of the fence) to edit or shoot random videos and photography with us.  We have a very minimal budget presently, but as the channels grow, the partnership-sponsorships will grow as well.  (more funds for everyone) So the real mission is to blow our You Tube and IG and various other SM channels up and make this a huge success ($$$ and Followers and DL's combined) 

If you happen to have an outdoor or festival product of your own, then we could of course intertwine that into the mix.  The colors of these channels will be good, pure, happy-adventurous vibes, no drugs, or alcohol or negative language.  There is also swag (High End Sun Glasses being one of them) available for anyone involved. Eventually We aim to cover all Festival Fees, or at least a portion of them, once the Channels Start Generating enough income.

Bay Area Freelance Front-end Developers,

I will help you get hired as a full-time developer at a big company like Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google, LinkedIn, or a medium sized company like Box, Personal Capital, Nordstrom.com, or a startup—whatever you’d like.

In the mean time, I can give you small freelance gigs for some extra cash and help with your resume, your portfolio site, the recruiter dance, technical interview coaching, and compensation negotiation.

What’s in it for me is that you help me get freelance development work done that meets my standards. I’ll help coach you to learn those standards in a casual, easygoing, way.

As much as you might need a full-job, it’s not going to happen right away—it’ll probably be weeks of prep and hustle.

Requirements:
1. You must have years of professional developer experience.
2. You might call yourself a mid-level front-end developer.
3. You live in the Bay Area or have plans to move here.
4. You’re hire-able.
5. You’re coach-able.

If everything above aligns with what you want, send me an email and tell me how you meet all the requirements—and please include your email address and freelance availability.

The series uses as a scaffolding/structure a number of true/legitimate historical events, including among them never-fore-unmasked issues/connections regarding President Theodore Roosevelt, his administration AND the impact of certain key/inciting incidents by the show's co-female protagonists that played a major, and never before credited connection to his administration and a lasting impact by these events on the country still felt in contemporary American society.

I am a tv show creator/writer/producer. 

I have written a scripted historical drama tv series inspired by true events set in New York City, Lower East Side, 1900.

The series uses as a scaffolding/structure a number of true/legitimate historical events, including among them never-fore-unmasked issues/connections regarding President Theodore Roosevelt, his administration AND the impact of certain key/inciting incidents by the show's co-female protagonists that played a major, and never before credited connection to his administration and a lasting impact by these events on the country still felt in contemporary American society. 

There are other key events of this ""never before told story"" that are easily ""google-able"" AND which have a high web presence and huge viral visibility. 

In addition to the actual episodes I have written for the show/series, I have also created an academic/thesis style paper that reflects these never-before revealed historical incidents. My paper is 44 pages long. Another 20 pages includes addenda regarding the actual tv series that sets the complete stage for the academic/historical incidents that are braided into the dramatic story. 

HERE IS THE JOB/TASK REQUIREMENT

I am seeking a Wikipedia Pro / Historian - Academic / Scholar / Writing Expert conversant in the described arenas/genres described above (and below)...

AND....

Using/taking my ""academic/thesis"" paper, along with other ""factual data"" using this info and then cross-referencing/citing MY academic/factual discoveries and integrating/adding the elements of my paper/tv show (for which there is an extensive and fabulous (presently unpublished website, we are not ready to go public with) AND have YOU integrate OUR facts/history, etc. into the webisphere adding OUR show info (facts/history) and include these bits of new and fascinating historical information/discoveries ON and INTO other Wikipedia Sites that specialize in these historical niches that our research AND the show addresses. The point of this exercise is that this will then drive traffic to, and link back to our show website and all other social media; all of this will create high level, highly credible awareness for our tv show/series and unmask this valuable educational information for a wide ranging audience. 

If you have proven expertise in Wikipedia, consider yourself a historical-enthusiast, OR, even better, are an academic/scholar with expertise in early 20th century history (story is set in NYC 1900), sub-niche exposure to President Theodore Roosevelt, Feminism, Feminist Movements, Jewish Feminism/ists, Early Jewish History, Early New York City/Lower East Side history, AND CAN WRITE.... then perhaps you might find this gig interesting.
